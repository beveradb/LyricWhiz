    "output": "My moon goes down, your sun comes up Is your rhythm natural, or down to luck?\nHear their feet in the corridor, hold my head down Life's becoming intolerable, since you're not around\nWhen they came looking, I struggled for a lie Can't have been too convincing, they took me for a ride\nSo I said you died\nSo I said you died\nSo I said you died\nSo I said you died\nThey said you lived, I said you'd gone Call me a liar\nI said they were wrong Show me a photograph, you needn't smile\nSaid it could be that I knew you, I said it's been a while\nI feel more peaceful now, if a little resigned Images all fade away, leaving me behind\nAnd it gives me the shivers, recordings of your voice Asking me for forgiveness, as if I had a choice\nSo I said you died\nSo I said you died\nSo I said you died\nSo I said you died\nAsking too many questions, endless interrogation Couriers carry clipboards and a map of the nation\nI got lost in a paragraph, was it something I signed? Left a promise on voicemail\nLost my heart and my mind\nNow they look at me funny, since you went away On the edge of the pavement, at the end of the day\nJust a name on my credit card, just a bruise in my pride Never knew what to tell them, so I said you died\nWe were in this together, must have done something wrong So you wrote me a letter, so I sang you a song\nNow I'm counting the seconds down, till they knock down the door Turning up with the tear gas, I'm not there anymore\n"
