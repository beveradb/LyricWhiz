    "output": "I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed\nThe hazy sunrise wraps a veil round my head\nI can't get motivated\nThe swimming thoughts are drowning in my head\nAnd if by some coincidence I do just what they said\nAnd the morning blue is warning you\nThe sabbath branch is storming through in the dawn of the morning blue\nJust take me away\nThe fire of failed reason and the rain of every season\nAnd the patriotic treason, the ringing of the bells\nThe avalanche of sorrow and the soul afraid tomorrow\nThere is not a day tomorrow, it's all about today\nAnd the morning blue is warning you\nThe sabbath branch is storming through in the dawn of the morning blue\nJust take me away\nSet me free and I will be afraid enough to find it\nTake my hand or take a stand and I would never mind it\nSit and stare or say a prayer for all you left behind\nCall me, just never be the last one left in line\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nI woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed\nI should have stayed in bed and slept all day instead\nThere ain't no profit in this day that lies ahead\nThese blurry images still echo in my head\nAnd the morning blue is warning you\nThe sabbath branch is storming through in the dawn of the morning blue\nAnd the morning blue is warning you\nThe sabbath branch is storming through in the dawn of the morning blue\nJust take me away"
