That I'm never gonna see you again\nDon't let me follow you into this disease I won't let you win\nI could have reached a hand to carry you out I could have jumped in on my own\nBut if you're gonna let yourself fall down You'll be going to the bottom of the hole\nThis ship is sinking and there's no way out You were the captain, I guess you're trapped in\nBut I don't know you, I don't owe you anything\nOh, did you believe what I said? That I'm never gonna see you again\nDon't let me follow you into this disease I won't let you win\n"
