What is your next wave? Wait, I'm not ready for it yet\nTears on my lips, it's getting cold The tears on my lips, it's getting cold The tears on my lips, it's getting cold The tears on my lips\nI don't want surprises You're full of surprises\nPlease don't try to surprise me\nI don't want surprises You're full of surprises\nI don't want surprises Please don't try to\nOh, sweetest love I think you're running too fast\nToo fast for me I cannot catch up with you now\nOh, sweetest love My hands are tied with your words\nAnd I know we have no good reason to talk\nYou're on a dangerous mind So I'd better step back\nYou're on a dangerous way So I'd better step back\nYeah, I'd better step back I know I'd better step back\nYeah, I'd better step back\nI don't want surprises You're full of surprises\nI don't want surprises You're full of surprises\nPlease don't try to surprise me\nI don't want surprises You're full of surprises\nI don't want surprises Please don't try to\n"}
