The stars are brightly shining, it is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining, till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.\nA thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.\nFall on your knees, O hear the angel voices, O night divine.\nO night when Christ was born, O night divine.\nLed by the light of faith, serenely beaming, with glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.\nSo led by light of a star sweetly gleaming, here come the wise men from Orient land.\nThe King of kings lays thus in lonely manger, in all our trials born to be our friend.\nHe knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger.\nBehold your King, before Him lonely bent.\nBehold your King, before Him lonely bent.\nTruly He taught us to love one another, His law is love and His gospel is peace.\nChains shall He break, for the slave is our brother, and in His name all oppression shall cease.\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, let all within us praise His holy name.\nChrist is the Lord, all praise His name forever.\nHis power and glory evermore proclaim.\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born.\nFall on your knees, O hear the angel voices.\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born.\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born.\n"}
