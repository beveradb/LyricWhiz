Heart's beat and the organs will grind\nI couldn't be the sea\nShips land on distant shores What are they calling me for?\nHow can they carry me?\nI'm a dark and angry daughter Rolling under warm water\nOld holes are in the brine Lying in silent decline\nI'm alone in afternoons Weighted down by soft tissues\nWho do they lean to?\nWho cradles my insides? Heart's beat and the organs will grind\nI couldn't be the sea\nShips land on distant shores What are they calling me for?\nHow can they carry me?\n"}
