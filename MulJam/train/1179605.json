{"reasons": "prediction_1 and prediction_0 have the same lyrics; prediction_2 is less accurate as it is missing artist and has small differences in lyrics", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "Money Man by Kool & The Gang\nI've seen it a bunch of times\nDeep in my sleep, in my mouth when I speak\nIt's something I seek, it stays stuck in my mind\nSomething I'm born to find\nBut I live to make it happen\nAttracting what I want with my actions\nYes, it's my passion regardless if y'all be laughing\nI'ma follow my intuition\nSome of y'all wishing for my failure\nBut it only falls on yourself\nGod knows my determination is a prayer\nThat's why you always send me help\nSo I'ma climb these steps and catch these dreams\nWith a reality check\nNo regrets\nCause I done paid my debts\nDreams do come true\nIt depends on how much you believe\nAnd to achieve you have to seize every moment\nAnd you gotta move at the speed of need\nGotta have some self esteem\nWrite it down, let it be a plan to be grand\nIt has to be an ideal\nThat's why you gotta keep it real\nChange the world, everything is possible\nJust do it\nYou have the power to influence nature\nJust do it\nA dream is real when it matches what you feel\nSo let faith be the antenna of your vision\nIf you wanna see clear\n"}
