{"reasons": "prediction_0 and prediction_2 are very similar, but prediction_2 has more consistent lines in terms of syllable count and clarity", "closest_prediction": "prediction_2", "output": "Send this to your mother, tell her it comes from me\nMake sure you tell her I wrapped it up neatly\nShe was right from the start when she said I was no good\nSaid I would break your heart if you knew I would\nGo tell your brother, the one who wants to kill me\nHe really shouldn't bother, risking the gallows for me\nIn fact he'd do me a favour by getting rid of me\nSo go tell your brother, tell him to take it easy\nAnd as for all our friends, they all took side with you\nThey'll hate me till the end, and I deserve it true\nSo what else could I do, except pack my stuff and go\nQuite a heart would feel that cold, and I would think of you\nReprobation, fabrication, self-loathing, self-mutilating\nThey say farewell is a cruel world, but all the words that I have heard\nThey suck the warmth right out of me, leave me dead as a Christmas tree\nSo while you smile and play the harp, I didn't see your teeth were sharp\nOnce they were planted in my neck, it was too late, now I'm a wreck\nSo go and show off your despair, wearing your most appealing hair\nYou will fool everyone I know, but for me it is time to go\nLife it sometimes takes strange turns, one hand caresses the other burns\nLove it sometimes has strange twists, my left hand's open, the right is a clenched fist\n"}
