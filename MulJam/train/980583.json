Shit, what's in the middle of a mince? What kind of hatred? What did you go away and leave me with? A hole in my heart, a hole in my heart\nThere's a half-bird, had one too, but he looked a fool And I love you and I don't know what I'm gonna do about this hole in my heart, this hole in my heart\nWhen we were together you had me in stitches But then you stitched me up, proper and now I'm in pieces I'm no longer laughing, no longer joking, there's a hole in my heart, it's broken\nWhen I was fragmented you made me whole But just like Dungey when he fell off the wall All the king's horses and all the king's men Can't put me back together again\nThis hole in my heart, this hole in my heart This hole in my heart, this hole in my heart\n"}
