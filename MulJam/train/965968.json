Can you show me the way back to you?\n Do you hate this silence? Do you hate this silence?\n Do you hate this silence between us?\n\n All around me is the silence of my soul\n I try to sing my song but it echoes off the wall\n That's why my tears are begging, please touch my ears\n I want to hear you clear, I want to feel you near\n I'm so ashamed of my fears\n This is the day I come back to you\n My friend, I could speak no more\n But I will sing songs again\n You fill up our silence, you fill it\n I'll take care of our love so it will grow with time\n You put meaning back in the emptiness of mine\n You fill up our silence, you fill up our silence\n You fill up our silence between us\n Between us\n\n Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na\n\n"}
