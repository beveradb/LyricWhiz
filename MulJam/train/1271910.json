Oh, I'm tired of lettin' you hold me\nI never felt so lonely I can make some excuse but I won't try\nCause you were lonely Oh, a moment of weakness\nA moment of weakness Oh, a moment of weakness\nA moment of weakness\nYeah, I was gone then You breathe me out, you breathe me in\nSo I keep on runnin' Yeah, I keep on runnin' from everywhere\nIt ain't true When you call me crazy When you say I'm easy for lovin' you\nBut what could I do? Oh, I'm tired of lettin' you hold me\nI never felt so lonely I can make some excuse but I won't try\nCause you were lonely Oh, a moment of weakness\nOh, I'm tired of lettin' you hold me I never felt so lonely I can make some excuse but I won't try\n"}
