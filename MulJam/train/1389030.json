Something's going to be changed\nCan you hear the growing sound? Storm is rising from the sands\nThen we waited to the lights Space ship flew above the sky\nOn a little man of hopes Do you retry to climb so high?\nI'm falling on the rocks Need a hand, believe me now\nAlways knew that you're my soul The perfect one I'll ever love\nCome on baby, don't you know? I think of you all the time\nWhen I just fell in love When I just fell in love\nGo!\nCan you see the hidden light? Shining out of black hole dark\nClose your eyes and let it go Sleep before she'll wake you up\nLove and war are coming soon Choose your side and join the fight\nWill the sun rise when the moon? Crash into it's burning heart\nI'm falling on the snow Need a hand, believe me now\nAlways knew that you're my soul The perfect one I'll ever love\nCome on baby, don't you know? I think of you all the time\nWhen I just fell in love When I just fell in love\nWith you\nWalk along the streets at night She is there right at your side\nAnd is lying on her shoulder Hand in hand and I'll be there\nCan you feel it in the air? Something's going to be changed\nWinds are breathing in your hair I think that you feel the same\nI'm falling on the rocks Need a hand, believe me now\nAlways knew that you're my soul The perfect one I'll ever love\nCome on baby, don't you know? I think of you all the time\nWhen I just fell in love When I just fell in love"}
