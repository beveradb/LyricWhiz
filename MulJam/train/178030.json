It's all about groove Knowledge makes the movements move\nHit flash, backlash, easily tamed Don't hate the players, hate the game\nSettle for a second, we ain't ready to beckon Obese, obvious, doing nothing but heckling\nMolded away like the gold of our past Buried in bunkers, covered by grass\nSynthetic by sounds, electronic in nature Suspended animation in the name of flavor\nIllible syllables, on our flow While the cynical one's stripped right on a strobe\nCan you feel the shit dance?\nCan't make a bigger boogie out\nPlease back the track, it's a heart attack Put your wax on car jack, run red black\nHe's a naval belligerent link, hold trap With a media bias and a feather on his cap\nThink of barons, construct a herd Donate a few bottles so they edit the blood\nIt'll wash the reel from the alley to the curb I'd go on for hours, but I'm very disturbed\nCan you feel the shit dance?\nCan't make a bigger boogie out\n"}
