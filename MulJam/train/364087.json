I'll never have enough, never have enough\nWill I forget who I am? I don't mind, I'm okay Don't need a supersized Nitro-Sun\nI can't see you, I'm so high that I don't mind being your toy\nEvery piece of myself feels the way I can feel you, I'm so high that I don't mind losing my pride\nEvery piece of myself feels the way\n"}
