{"reasons": "consistency;lyric_structure", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "I know there's no use getting angry I know there's no use being sad\nI'm much too tired to lose my temper on you These small mercies make me glad\nEscape into another world if it isn't here There's no joy and yet no pain\nBut who's that man? I heard myself talking Lines on my face like rain on filthy windows\nBut who's that man? I heard myself talking Lines on my face like rain on filthy windows\nSpent all my money playing card games No one taught me how to lose\nThat's not to say I won So with the damage done I guess the opposite is true\nWho might save me from this boy?\nBut who's that man? I heard myself talking Lines on my face like rain on filthy windows\nI know it's time for a decision If there is any point at all\nThe drugs take care of my ambition A part of me must take a fall\nThis must be my last half hour, yeah\nInstrumental\nSledge my name on your desk with the fountain pen This means I'll be on, yeah\nSledge my name on your desk with the fountain pen This means I'll be on, yeah\nOutro\n"}
