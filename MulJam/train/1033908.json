Your dreams arrive to give me the blues\nBut it's true, can you stand your reflection? Cause otherwise you have to pretend that you're the kill that day\nI step in and see you brave into your hate and pain\nAfraid to step from the line, no matter where it takes\nEvery call, your past, your past has no end\nYour present is such a mess, you've got a kill that day\nEvery time I realize what you do, I got a pain of hate in my heart\nBut then I see whatever happens to you, one day you're calling on the other goodbye\nIs that you, from another dimension?
