Take your hand, whisper it in your ear\nSweet as an angel, remember you Gazing seriously\nThanks to a jerk walking up to you, previous me\nBut once I had you loosen up I introduced myself with an unseducing touch\nFooled myself to be the trusted type Never thought a club night would show me what real love is like\nDamn, hold you tight Never would've let you go\nNo matter what you might do, always stay by your side\nThere's nothing you and I can't get through I'ma hold you up, baby\nWhenever you have a problem I'ma hold you up\nWhen you're doing the service, make it worth it I'ma still give you all of my love\nSomewhere around 96 I met this party, introduced to this dude named Mr. Smith\nI'm like, whoa, that song is nice Didn't understand a word, but that's quite alright\nI moved my lips like I really did, knew the lyrics Looked so stupid, like some kind of remix\nCopped that album right away, started to study Make my own rhymes, night and days\nGoing through my mind, what I would like to say And finally, I was able to bring out\nEverything about me, got my own style And started to represent it proudly\nSometimes I go back to old notepads To remind myself of the times when I was so wack\nBut I kept going, my vision was clear Like it or not, I ain't going nowhere\nHold you tight Never would've let you go\nNo matter what you might do, always stay by your side\nThere's nothing you and I can't get through I'ma hold you up, baby\nWhenever you have a problem I'ma hold you up\nI'll hold you up when you don't deserve it It ain't really worth it, I must forgive you\nAll of my age\nI probably never make million bucks Have enough cash to appeal some love\nNever drive a car that's fast enough Or be VIP for the night up in the clubs\nBut if you ask me, I got pretty enough I might not be wealthy, but I'm healthy\nAnd I got some love, so in other words I'm thankful to God for everything I have\nAnd everything I have not\nHold you tight Never would've let you go\nNo matter what you might do, always stay by your side\nThere's nothing you and I can't get through I'ma hold you up, baby\nWhenever you have a problem I'ma hold you up\nAll of my love\nI must forgive you\nAll of my love\nI must forgive you\nAll of my love\nI must forgive you\nAll of my love\n"}
