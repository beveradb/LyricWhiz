{"reasons": "Capitalization consistency;Repetition removal;", "closest_prediction": "prediction_2", "output": "As the light becomes dim, it's night once again.\nThe image is changing in time.\nThe eyes focus on all the things that are gone,\nAnd you look to your dreams for a sign.\nBut you don't seem to notice the flickering light,\nAnd you can't see the scar for the burn.\nAll you feel in your heart is the beating apart\nOf the life you thought was your own.\nAs the dust settles down and you're walking around,\nSearching more with your patience than haste.\nIt is easy to see that you're blind when you're free,\nAnd the love that you have is to waste.\nYou see the things that you've lost, and you say that it's just,\nAnd they equal the things that you gain.\nBut it's a fool who believes in the torture of thieves,\nAnd the parting of heat from a flame.\nThe watch on your arm tells the time in a line,\nAnd precision that stops you in starts.\nYou look to the sky in the hope to find why,\nBut the clouds are just questioning marks.\nAnd the rain's pouring down as you walk into town,\nAnd you think of the warm and the snug.\nIt's beer that you drink as an aid to your think,\nBut it ain't nothing more than a drug.\nAnd a cigarette smokes as it teases and jokes,\nAnd it laughs at the way that you boast.\nCos there ain't hope for much when the tenderest touch\nCan bring tears to the eyes of the ghost.\nAs the leaves turn brown on the trees,\nAnd then fall to their death with the rain,\nI believe that is how it should be,\nAnd I know that it will be again.\nCos it don't mean a thing that you go from this world,\nAnd it don't mean a thing when you do.\nIf I had one dream to be real,\nThen that dream to be real would be true.\n"}
