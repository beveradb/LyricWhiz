Maybe in grey I heard myself talking, been lying all day\nLines on my face like rain on filthy windows Who's that man? Maybe in grey\nI heard myself talking, been lying all day Lines on my face like rain on filthy windows\nSpent all my money playing card games No one taught me how to lose\nThat's not to say I won So with the damage done I guess the opposite was true\nWho might save me from this boredom?\nBut who's that man? Maybe in grey I heard myself talking, been lying all day\nLines on my face like rain on filthy windows Who's that man? Maybe in grey\nI heard myself talking, been lying all day Lines on my face like rain on filthy windows\nI know it's time for a decision If there is any point at all\nThe drugs take care of my addiction A part of me must take the fall\nThis must be my last half hour\nSpread my name on your desk with a fountain head\nThis means I really own you\nSpread my name on your desk with a fountain head\nThis means I really own you\n"}
