Would you please tell me where?\nIf you see her Would you let her know that I'm there?\nThat I love her And I miss her so\nTo win back her love There's nothing I wouldn't do\nShe said that she loved me But now she is gone\nI thought it was forever I was so wrong\nIt wasn't enough To reopen her heart\nI'll have to listen I'm going out of my mind\nHave you seen her around? Would you let her know that I'm there?\nIf you see her around Would you please tell me where?\nTell me where to start\nThere's nothing at all That I wouldn't do\nTo win her love\nThere's nothing at all That I wouldn't do\nTo win her love\nThere's nothing at all That I wouldn't do\n"}
