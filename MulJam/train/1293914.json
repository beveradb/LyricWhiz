Then we can take her down\nDown, we can take her down\nCamera lights, candle lights Let's do it right, all night\nThree heartbeats under the moonlight Turn up, turn up, turn up once I get inside\nYou on me and me on you She on you and you on her\nI'm on her and we on we We gon' do it right\nThree's company too, yeah\nI'm down, I'm down And she's down, she's down\nAre you down? Then we can take her down\nDown, we can take her down\nLet's add some flavor We can have her now and have her later\nSexy light skin, mixy red velvet cake I like to mix my flavors\nAnd I don't see nothing wrong With a little bumpy ground\nAnd you tell me you want some foam play Baby, we can really take our time\nTake off your gown, take off your shoes Get you in the mood, I'ma be smooth\nLight up this blood, take a sip of that Lay on by your side\nI'm down, I'm down And she's down, she's down\nAre you down?
