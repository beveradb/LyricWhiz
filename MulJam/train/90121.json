You have to choose\nWhat would you do? You need to choose\nThe place where children go away to flee\nThe place where children set fire in your skin\nWhen I think about the children whose only toy\nAre the weapons they get from the West\nThey could have dignity, oh my children\nLeave the weapon, take paper and pen\nNow I know that the answers they were searching for\nThey were stolen as mine was their future\nOnly they still have tribal battles, woods are away\nLet me tell you that children have frozen\n24 hours a day of work, woods are away\nWhat would you do? You have to choose\nWhat would you do? You need to choose\nThe place where children go away to flee\nThe place where children set fire in your skin\nDrop some fire on your skin\nLook up there on the tribe, the fear that brings\nRages of killer children, they were not born a good way\nThey were stolen from law by Babylon's system\nThey were stolen from law by Babylon's system\n"}
