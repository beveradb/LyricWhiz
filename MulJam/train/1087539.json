Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\nDashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh\nOver the fields we go, laughing all the way\nBells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright\nWhat fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\nA day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride\nAnd soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side\nThe horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his luck\nHe got into a drifted bag and wee-wee got up-sot\nYeah\nOh\nOh\nOh\nNow the ground is white, go it while you're young\nTake the girls tonight and sing a sleighing song\nJust get a bob-tail bait, two forty for his speed\nThen hit him to an open slide and crack you'll take the lead\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\nJingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh\n"}
