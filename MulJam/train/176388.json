Is it you I feel?\nIs it you inside my heart? Is it you I feel here?\nLay down the fire Lay down the hurt inside your eyes\nLay down your purpose Let me see into who I am\nIs it you inside my head? Is it you I feel?\nIs it you inside my heart? Is it you?\nYeah!\nIs it you inside my head? Is it you I feel?\nIs it you inside my heart? Is it you?\nIs it you under my skin? Is it you I feel?\nIs it you inside my smile? Is it you I feel?\n"}
