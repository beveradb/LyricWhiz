Mends clothes? Who rakes the leaves? Who changes the oil?\nWho's the man? Who wears the pants? Who's in control? Who wants it more?\nWho works more hours? Who pays the bills? Who cleans the shower?\nWho plays more sports? Who drinks the beer? Who sips wine?\nWho cools? Who sleeps? Who does the laundry? Who cleans the kitchen?\nWho's the man? Who wears the pants? Who's in control? Who wants it more?\nWho's the man? Who wears the pants? Who's in control? Who wants it more?\nWe're women, both wear their pants. We're in control, we do it all.\nDo, do, do, do.\n"}
