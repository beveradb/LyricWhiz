What if we sold it?\nWhat do you mean we can't sell that?\nOf course we can, of course\nThey will rush to the store\nAnd they will buy their own crap if we tell them to\nWhat we need is a catchy slogan\nWhat we need is a sexy package\nWhat we need is a movie or a football star\nAnd believe me, the cattle will buy whatever we advise them to\nSo what are we waiting for? Let's go!\nLet's make billions, billions, zillions, trillions\nIncredibly, enormously, fabulously\nBig, big, big, big, bigillions!\nBig, big, big, big, big, bigillions!\nAfter all this situation, it's probably right\nIf we buy it, it means we're satisfied\nIf we have the cash, then we can complain\nIt's all that matters in the end\nAll the bull that they tell us\nLook at us straight in the eyes\nThey don't have enough respect for us\nNot even for a plausible lie\n"}
