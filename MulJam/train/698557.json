{"reasons": "similar_lyrics", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "Life is good without you I wish I could stretch out that day\nAnd I'm glad, don't you? I'm glad it's true Not gonna find you everywhere\nEach day makes me complete The pain has gone, I feel relieved\nSo many questions and so few answers In the end, lots of contradictions\nLife is good without you Fear is in every move I make\nAnd when the day is new I ask myself\nWhen did we make the first mistake?\nLife's so new without you And that's a different point of view\nShould try to look at it objectively And I'll soon be back in my feet\nWhen tears and sadness ruin your mood When you're through this world\nThere's only one thing you can do Is raise a fist and rub that yoke\nThen I'm good without you I heard you spitting on my name\nAnd in a week or three I'll hear that shit\nNot gonna find you everywhere\nLife is good without you I think I'll ring Sue, Mark and Beth\nI hope you'll understand If I'm not calling you\nDamn, I'm good without you Took my best few straight shots that day\nAnd I feel wildly, don't you? I thank God for that day\nFor that holy, holy day\n"}
