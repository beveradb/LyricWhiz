I wonder who's possessed it by whom?\nNaked I was born, naked I die, the rest is illusion.\nYou, you're always there, you never let me down, even if I'm not there.\nWhat are my dreams, when I wake up all my thoughts will fade away?\nFriends are to go, I'm left alone, I have to live that every day.\nYou, you're always there, you never let me down, even if I'm not there.\nWhat is my life, why did I do it? I built my house in the sand.\nIn angry years, what will remain when everything will have to end?\nYou, you're always there, you never let me down, even if I'm not there.\nYou, you're always there, you never let me down, even if I'm not there.\nOh, you, you're always there, you never let me down, even if I'm not there.\n"}
