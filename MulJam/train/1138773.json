I thought the search was done\nInside this battle that nobody has won\nI'm so afraid of what giving up will mean\nI am all alone, I've been running in this scene\nInside my movie that you no longer star\nI need your arms, I can't feel them from afar\nI'm cracking jokes of fake hearty ha-ha\nJumps out the car, I wanna be right where you are\nI can't see you anymore\nI am blinded\nMy eyes are on the floor\nI can't see you anymore\nI am blinded\nMy eyes are on the floor\nTell me where you are\nI hear you mine, I hear your heart is broken\nLife can make you feel so high or make you feel like broken\nSo even though you lost a love you still preserve another\nThe love that comes within yourself no matter what the weather\nAnd I know it seems like you and him were birthed to the same feather\nThere's always different reasonings why people come together\nSo even though you feeling down you're really blossoming\nAnd even though you're teary now I still can see a queen\nAnd I see that you love your body so much\nAnd you probably toss and turn a night long if all is touched\nLove gives you adrenaline, a woman rap and rush\nKeep your memories alive, don't discord, don't you flush\nLet it all out, don't you keep it on the hush\nI'm here for you, I'm all ears if you have stuff to discuss\nPick your head up, mommy, you know I hate to see you crushed\nTrust, destiny has showed your back so don't you miss your bus\nAs much as I see it as a must that you rise and materialize\nBack into the strong queen that you are\nAnd please don't let your sorrow do the brightness in your star\nHappiness is round the bend even if it may seem far\nI can't see you anymore\nI am blinded, my eyes are on the floor\nI can't see you anymore\nI am blinded, my eyes are on the floor\nTell me where you are\nTell me where you are\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do\nI can't hold you even after all that we've been through\nThis love is real and I pray for you, my king\nAnd if my crown falls, I will still sing\nTo the heavens, so much joy you can bring\nTo this world where we both fight for everything\nSeeking justice, we will hold it in our hearts\nSomeday our purpose will be filled and we can start\nTo build our life, but can we wait?\nThis love is so easily turned to hate\nCause I am angry that you had to go\nBut I understand and I hope you know\nThat I will never love someone like this\nThis ying and yang, it's a balanced bliss\nPushing me farther than I have ever been\nThe support of a god and I'll be missing that grin\nI can't see you anymore\nI am blinded, my eyes are on the floor\nI can't see you anymore\nI am blinded, my eyes are on the floor\nTell me where you are\nTell me where you are\n"}
