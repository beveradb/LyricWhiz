What's in your smiles?\nThat drives me, that excites me God knows I never really wanted to\nBut this is what you drive me to Never really wanted this\nBut you drive me with your kiss What's in your eyes? What's in your cries?\nWhat's in your smiles? That drives me, that excites me\nHooked on a drug that ain't you I'm certain of the things I do\nKnowing that it won't release But I just can't resist\nWhat's in your eyes? What's in your cries? What's in your smiles?\nThat drives me, that excites me\nNo time to wonder what we've got All is silence on our talk\nAnd if we're in the midst We live without risk\nWhat's in your eyes? What's in your cries? What's in your smiles?\nThat drives me, that excites me\nWhat's in your eyes? What's in your cries? What's in your smiles?\nThat drives me, that excites me\nGod knows I never really wanted to But this is what you drive me to\nNever really wanted this But you drive me with your kiss\nWhat's in your eyes?
