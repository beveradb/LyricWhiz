To be paralyzed?\nAm I losing my soul trying to find the light? Are these silly answers from these men in ties?\nI'm too grown to be lost, but they told me I'm wrong\nIt's what we seek, it's what you need It's all I seek, is to be free\nAnd I know someday I'll find my way It's what we seek\nShould I leave home and never look back? This ain't the life I wanted, was good or bad\nThis feeling inside has taken over me Do I look like poison, sweet insanity?\nI'm too grown to be lost, but they told me I'm wrong\nIt's what we seek, it's what we need It's all I seek, is to be free\nAnd I know someday I'll find my way It's what you seek\nAm I losing my soul? Am I out of control? Is this what you wanted, a perfect boy?\nAm I losing my mind? What am I trying to find? It's not a choice I made\nI was born this way It's what we seek\nIt's what we seek\nIt's what you seek, it's what we need It's all I seek, is to be free\nAnd I know someday I'll find my way It's what we seek\nIt's what you seek\n"}
