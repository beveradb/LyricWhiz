I've been worried sick\nAnd now I'm sick and tired\nDon't make it any worse by saying things\nThat neither of us will ever believe are true\nLike I love you\nIt's mundanely romantic saying goodbye through a window\nWaving off at a station, sending texts on arrival\nAnd scrimping and saving with talk of survival\nBeyond understanding where money doesn't matter\nBecause love's everlasting if you send it by email\nIt's mundanely romantic\nExcept when they say\nWhere were you last night? I've been worried sick\nAnd now I'm sick in the head\nLet's not make it any worse by saying things\nThat neither of us should have ever said\nLike I wish that you were dead\nIt's mundanely romantic\nBut it could really be romantic if you try a little harder\nYes, it could really be romantic if you tried a little harder\n"}
