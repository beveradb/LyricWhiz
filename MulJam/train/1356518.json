{"reasons": "better coherence and more unique lines", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "You must believe me, Suspicious girl like me,\nI can't remember nothing, Of what I did,\nI met a good friend of mine, Also she was a king,\nYou said I did it, But for what?\nFor money, power, fame, I heard someone whisper in her,\nThe blood was everywhere, I knew the gun was in my hand,\nOf course it was red-hit, When I came to myself,\nShe was already dead, She was lying in her bed,\nWith a bullet in her head, The colours of my beatrine faded,\nFrom being kept in light,\nTwo days of bloody murder, Now willing to shoot me on sight,\nThey think I'm the wildest, And they know I'm a brutal one,\nI think I am, If only I was one,\nI'd give death to my friends, The world could be my throne,\nI'd be the first man in space, My breath would make a meridian,\nAs imagery would run away, Stuff I used to show and pose,\nIt seems like a wishful, To bring a human rose,\nIt's a woman they like, The fate of each man,\nIf human is to break his bread, The rat to walk his land,\nThe colours of my beatrine faded, From being kept in light,\n"}
