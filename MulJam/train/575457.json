{"reasons": "more coherent punctuation; consistent wording;", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "I've been living in the past, sailed this ship without a mast,\nDrowned upon a foreign sea, the compass points no way for me now,\nBut how could I have known that this bird had flown far away from here too late?\nI'm not the man I was, better for the loss, it's said.\nYet I'm still saving tears for you, I know that I'll be needing them soon,\nAnd can you shelter from the rain behind the waterfall?\nBlack dark betrayed their places, the puppet master's strings leave traces,\nThe empty space looms unknown, face is hollow.\nLove's not looking out for me, I'm in a forest of silent trees,\nOnly touching in a storm, not embracing till they're all down,\nResting on the ground, coming home has found the peace we're seeking,\nBut oh, love, what a price to pay, isn't there a way around this?\nSo now this love has said its last goodbye, no tears or fears or many years will revive,\nThe broken keepsakes on the cracked and weathered stones, flickering in candlelight,\nShadows moving through the night, sleepless now but waiting for the dawn.\n"}
