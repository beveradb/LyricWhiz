Gates I ain't neither\nDon't want no problems with the kid, better act right\nI keep them hollows in the clip on my black 9\nI'm sipping bottles of the Chris with a fat dime\nThat I'm a twist till I'm bent or a flat line\nDon't want no problems with the kid, better act right\nI keep them hollows in the clip on my black 9\nI'm sipping bottles of the Chris with a fat dime\nThat I'm a twist till I'm bent or a flat line\nI move smooth with them 22's on the whip\nAnd take a cruise on the corner rule with a chick\nThat love my style, love to go down and swallow dick\nAnd when they go down, she throw rounds with hollow tips\nThe type of chick that'll stick clowns up for them bricks\nAnd when they get pounded, go down right where they live\nI keep my chick on some G shit, how to E shit\nPull her heat quick, keep a secret\nSo if she ever get knocked, she won't speak it\nAnd if she ever get shot, won't tell her these shit\nI keep her in a three drop because it's decent\nThe same shit I cop to keep my mane squeezing\nSnitches wanna be cops until they leaking\nYou leave them on the street pop, they won't speak then\nI'm only trying to see guap that have me breathing\nRunning streets in the latest V's and Breeze and yeah\nDon't want no problems with the kid, better act right\nI keep them hollows in the clip on my black 9\nI'm sipping bottles of the Chris with a fat dime\nThat I'm a twist till I'm bent or a flat line\nDon't want no problems with the kid, better act right\nI keep them hollows in the clip on my black 9\nI'm sipping bottles of the Chris with a fat dime\nThat I'm a twist till I'm bent or a flat line\n"}
