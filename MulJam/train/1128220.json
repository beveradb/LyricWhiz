{"reasons": "Identical predictions", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "I remember the snow from time so long ago\nAll stacked in piles that went four miles in the air\nI climb right up to the top, the tallest kid on the block\nDid the piles get smaller? Did I get taller?\nDid everything just shrink away?\nI can't remember the change, but everything was rearranged\nEvery day, there's something that goes away\nIt's leaking like a faucet, I never knew I lost it\nUntil I wake up old and gray\nAnd every day, I wake up and see my face\nThe reflection is familiar, just dustier and blurrier\nSo suddenly, a stranger shakes my hand\nThe one-way arrow of time, you can choose to ignore the sign\nBut you don't get to do the driving or know when you're arriving there\nThe seconds, minutes, and days all pass with a gentle pace\nBut suddenly we stack up, watching as we rack up the changes that we never see\nBut we are never the same, don't blink your eyes or you might miss it\nEvery day, there's something that goes away\nIt's leaking like a faucet, I never knew I lost it\nUntil I wake up old and gray\nAnd every day, I wake up and see my face\nThe reflection is familiar, just dustier and blurrier\nSo suddenly, a stranger shakes my hand\nYou can't chase the breeze, cause you're never gonna catch it\nCan't stop the seas, when the waves come crashing\nCan't hold your dreams, when the sunlight fills the room\nWhen you're asleep, when you're awake\nThe sum of every breath you take\nInvisible, but slowly multiply\nWhistling\nEvery day, there's something that goes away\nIt's leaking like a faucet, I never knew I lost it\nUntil I wake up old and gray\nAnd every day, I wake up and see my face\nThe reflection is familiar, just dustier and blurrier\nSo suddenly, a stranger shakes my hand\n"}
