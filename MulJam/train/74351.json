My car, backseat, tonight\nCause tonight you're my ride I like my passenger's light\nI think it's time for you to shine Girl, you know my mind\nGirl, you're so fine I like the way you run\nGirl, I need to make you mine\nCome on, let's get it on Let's get it on, let's get it on\nLet's get it on, let's get it on\nI'mma tell you how I feel Girl, you're like my weed\nWhenever I wanna get high You're the thing I need\nIt's time for you to see You're the one I need\nIt's better that you believe You're the one for me\nSo why don't we get it on? Let's get it on, let's get it on\nGet it on, get it on\n"}
