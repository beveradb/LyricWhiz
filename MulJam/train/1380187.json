I can't say that I don't want more\nTwo faced in a separated heartbeat, you can't say that you know for sure\nNo way, she don't even like me, I can't say that I don't want more\nTwo ways for my heart to die slowly, I don't wanna be friends, no, no\nYou hit me up with a text, you were asking to roll through\nWith a couple symbols you'd be sending the context\nThings were simple till you came in my complex, now things are just nonsense\nGoing through the motions, you, you play with my emotions\nBut I'm not a video game, no, no\nAwaken with a cold sweat, I make smoke to fill the air\nSitting on my doorstep since I sold my only chair\nIt's eleven in the evening, I'm sitting on the floor\nCause my bed is empty, and my lungs are sore\nNo way, do you even like me? I can't say that I don't want more\nTwo faced in a separated heartbeat, you can't say that you know for sure\nNo way, she don't even like me, I can't say that I don't want more\nTwo ways for my heart to die slowly, I don't wanna be friends, no, no\nTwo ways for my heart to die slowly, I don't wanna be friends, no, no\nTwo ways for my heart to die slowly, I don't wanna be friends, no, no\n"}
