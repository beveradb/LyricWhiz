You don't care for false glamour, splendour\nThe children cry in burning beds, nobody will save them\nBecause the cruelly sweet seducer invites you to the table\nHe captures the souls, he captures the souls\nTherefore accept it as it is and sing the end is near, so he says\nAnd he knows that no soul is caping in the end\nTherefore accept it as it is and sing the end is near, so he says\nAnd he knows that no soul is caping in the end\nSo celebrate your little fate in fully laid and pleaded saving song\nRaise your glasses and abjure the meanings deep inside you\nWith every badness\nYou are the burning child, but you work out from singing\nThe music seems strange to you and unknown but is your pure match?\nThat sounds so sweet, that sounds so sweet\nTherefore accept it as it is and sing the end is near, so he says\nAnd he knows that no soul is caping in the end\nTherefore accept it as it is and sing the end is near, so he says\nAnd he knows that no soul is caping in the end\nTherefore accept it as it is and sing the end is near, so he says\nAnd he knows that no soul is caping in the end\n"}
