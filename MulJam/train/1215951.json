{"reasons": "minor_errors;", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "What can you do? You make your mistakes You wouldn't be you without them\nYou could chop off your head Or jump in the lake\nDig out your sorrows and drown them\nYou could get so used to it When there's no more use for it\nIt could still be there behind you\nOld photographs, memories and laughs Pictures of times when things seemed better\nBut take the advice Stop and think twice\nBefore you read your old love letters\nSinging along to a favourite song Striking too many chords to mention\nJewellery rings, all of those things Can you remember who even gave them?\nOr is it just so much of it That you're just confused by it?\nWell you might as well forget them\nAnd take the advice Of sleeping dogs' lives\nJust go on sleeping\nDo you recall When you were smaller\nHow some things just didn't matter?\nLook forward to seeing How it will be\nWhen you are six feet under\nAnd there's no use for you Just a history record\nYou might as well have a good one\nWhat can you do? You make your mistakes\nYou wouldn't be you without them\n"}
