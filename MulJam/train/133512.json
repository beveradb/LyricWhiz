The things that make you stronger\nIt's just another day, Just another day\nAnother day without sun Just another day\nAnother day without fun, Just another day\nAnother day with no sun, Just another day\nMy body starves again, Do I know what I need?\nI feel some kind of pain, Would you call that greed?\nHow can you smile without? I could not any longer\nHow can you live without? Things that make you stronger\nMy last midnight abuse With a donation\nBut I think I'm immune\nIt's just another day, Just another day\nAnother day without sun, Just another day\nAnother day without fun, Just another day\nAnother day without sun, Just another day\n"}
