I know I'm untrue But I'll give you romantic lies\nLonging sighs, lies for your hair There's no getting through to this dead-end dude\nWhen spring is in the air By subway nights and high-rise sites\nSkies scrape away through you And no stupid law, no, no law can take your pride\nRomantic lies, longing sighs, flowers for your hair\nThere's no getting through to this dead-end dude When spring is in the air\nNo lonely night gonna make it right Eyes scrape away through you\nAnd no law, no, no stupid law can take your pride\n"}
