{"reasons": "more accurate and coherent lyrics", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "You must look side to side Of a vanishing star in the sky\nShe looks deadly apart In this world of art\nA Californian ride Would do her good to warm up her soul\nShe held a clue in her hand But she don't give a damn anymore\nWho rest lies in the sand Wonders where the good dreams have gone\nHope of freedom and love Buried with the plants of a better world\nShe's about to lose her mind She's about to lose her time\nShe has given up the fight But she'll be fine\nWho is love at your side? She knows the magic will fade in a while\nNo need to question why For she knows it won't forever last\nWho is love at your side?\n"}
