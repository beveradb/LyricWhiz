{"reasons": "exact_same_lyrics", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "The summer comes and the summer goes\nIf I quit work, do you think anyone would know\nTo come and go just as I please\nWell that seems like a quite nice idea\nBut I'm stuck here\nSo little time, I've got to show you why\nI had a dream beneath a grey-fanged sky\nI fritted all my youth away\nWith comic sweets and 48k\nWell that was okay\nAnd favourite pop stars whose posters you cherished\nAnd bags of sweet candy and fruit flavoured chews\nAnd pets that belong to a friendly old neighbour\nAnd big beasties that only came on the box\nAnd breakfast cereals with far too much sugar\nAnd coffee that made you burst all hyperactive\nAnd toys that belong to your best friend from school time\nYou wanted, you saved up, you counted the days\nAnd programmes you watched when you should have been sleeping\nAnd nights spent in blankets with books read by torchlight\nAnd diaries you started and covered with stickers\nAnd best clothes you wanted to wear for all time\nTo wear for all time\nTo wear for all time\nGive me my childhood\nPreserved green and friendly\nHelp me remember\nWhat I have forgotten\nLead me on back through\nThe mists of my mindscape\nShow me again\nWhat it meant to be young\n"}
