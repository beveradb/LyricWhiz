They go from strength to strength.\n9 The God of gods will be seen in Zion, O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer.\n1 Give ear, O God of Jacob!\nSelah\n10 For just one day within your courts is better than a thousand gone.\n11 I would rather keep the door than live in tents of sin.\n12 For the Lord God is a sun and a shield, he gives favour and honour.\n13 No good thing does God withhold from those who walk uprightly.\n1 O Lord God of hosts, happy are all who trust in you.\nNew Revised Standard Version Bible, copyright \u00a9 1989, 1995 the Division of Christian Education of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America.
