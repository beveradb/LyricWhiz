The vision's coming true\nAnd you have taught me very well The stories I will tell\nWhen I reach and drink from Avalon's well\nWhat does it mean to say I'll dedicate my life For one who's never kept a vow?\nWhat does it mean to say I'll live my life for you?\nWhat makes me think I'll live it now? Except who\nLoves me like you do? The vision's coming true\nAnd you have taught me very well The stories I will tell\nWhen I finally drink from Avalon's well\nAs the path before me unwinds with a misty haze I know that I'm much stronger now\nI've overcome the storms I've faced in my life It is you who showed me how\nAnd who has loved me like you do? The vision's coming true\nAnd you have taught me very well The stories I will tell\nWhen I finally reach Avalon's well\nWhen I finally reach Avalon's well\nWhen I finally reach Avalon's well\n"}
