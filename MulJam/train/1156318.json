Is there a reason you paint it all black?\nI'm gonna bring you a parachute I'm gonna make you feel fine\nTo jump off that rock that is holding you back and live it up\nYou tried yourself but you got stuck in the motion Your world of feelings are bleeding you dry\nJust spread up half your life, your edges are broken But where we're going is low, no turning back\nI'm gonna bring you a parachute I'm gonna make you feel fine\nTo jump off that rock that is holding you back and live it up\nSo baby, baby, baby, won't you listen to me? I've got this feeling this will all be smooth sailing\nNow baby, baby, baby, won't you hear me out? Bring back the love you miss, you know what I'm saying\nI'm gonna bring you a parachute I'm gonna make you feel fine\nTo jump off that rock that is holding you back and live it up\nCause I'm gonna bring you a parachute I'm gonna make you feel fine\nTo jump off that rock that is holding you back and live it up\n"}
