You, who is no longer here\nThere are so many reasons that I miss\nSongs lost, that shut up and will not return\nI am pure freedom\nI live, I live, in freedom\nEach sense and each great dream\nMakes me be the owner of each breath that\nMakes me be the owner of each breath\nMakes me be the owner of each breath\nThanks for watching!\n"}
