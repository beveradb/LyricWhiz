{"reasons": "consistency;completeness", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "Yeah, Kelly Mays, Asia Feminine 2.0, Mookie, Eminem, Snoop Dee's, trying to make you proud.\nI'm gonna record this in one take, hopefully.\nI'll break it down into sections, I'll make my selections,\nNow Kelly Mays will be in all your ad mentions,\nThey say it's heavy when she talk about our venture,\nRelease the tension, she'll get my brethren,\nYou see this system has long been a joke,\nPatriarchy will kill an innocent folk,\nIn a cell in hell, very little hope,\nCould've been a leader but they got him pushing dope,\nHands around the neck, can't breathe, choke,\nTaking basic human rights, revoke,\nWho we blindly follow, slaunting at the yo,\nThe demon is inside, see it through the smoke,\nAnd we don't want Eve, catch on their balls,\nSick of the world, they've been acting like Hannibal,\nYou don't believe in, death or power,\nFuck the thrill, and the watchtower now,\nDo you have the balls, or are you a coward,\nI can hear the masses and they keep getting louder,\nStop popping their pills and cruising up the powder,\nBelieve in yourself, fuck that internal war,\nStop popping their pills and cruising up the powder,\nCome on ladies, it's time to stand up,\nI ain't falling, take away your girls crutch,\nWe gotta make moves, it's time to break through,\nIt's the age of feminine, what you gonna do,\nTwo choices, take over or watch the babies die,\nFor you they all gun blast, see the way they cry,\nYou've been muted, like a shot, I can hear them sigh,\nAre we waiting on the devil, a guide for a piece of pie,\nMe and my ladies, we'll grind and teach,\nPracticing and preaching, learn and teach,\nInhaling the weed, secret in me,\nMy mind and my pen bleed, no sleep,\nCause I've been real far, from casual,\nI'm a serious bitch, I'm writing a manual,\nFuck the chit-chats, we'll talk, we sound like Hannibal Lecter,\nCome see me light on the spectro in the US,\nWho was the real threat, I know you suspect,\nHow are you reflecting, lethal inject,\nWe're Aids, we're infect, about to confess,\nUntil then I'll be writing, I'm done, I'll be writing checks,\nBut don't get me wrong, I love our men,\nBut the days of that female circus,\nWe back when, not over my friend,\nHuman rights are misdefended,\nIn the feminine energy, it's a yin trend,\nWe must spread that positive vibe,\nWanna cleanse the aura, no need to hide,\nLove your neighbor, smiling at a stranger,\nFuck your pride, we're in a state of danger,\nThe devil, he is crept inside,\nBut when the women gather, the world will hear,\nIt's written in the holy books, come on strike a deal,\nThat you don't worry about your looks, let's be real,\nSee the beauty inside, you've been duped, break the seal,\nHope we'd prophecy, no shidama, screw the tea,\nIt's a duty to return the mother to the tree,\nWhat are the root, it's an emergency,\nAge of Aquarius, raining water, second pre now,\nLet me leave you with one final message,\nLove your enemy and yourself, I am requesting,\nThat we all join hands in existential connection,\nI am you, you are me, there is no discretion,\nAnd I will be investing, in humanity's ascension,\nHow we learn this lesson,\nKnowing that it's best and cursed,\nIt isn't misgiven, and it is written in visions,\nInside of alien prisons, because I made my decision,\nBefore this body was given,\nKnowing that I will be fitting,\nMy girl with ancestral wisdom,\nRepping for all of my women,\nAsia, I will continue to receive,\nCC, I will continue to receive,\nCynical, I will continue to receive,\nAnd now ladies and gentlemen, just hear the X,\nWe write our history in advance,\nThis is scripture, it's not a mystery,\nHow my hand is painting the picture,\nThis is God's guidance, it's for our science,\nAnd it's saying you can call me the Lord's appliance,\nIt's like these rappers are born silent,\nCause they ain't saying anything even worth being heard,\nAfter a break they pause like you birthed the words,\nAnd watch them fly over the earth like birds,\nThen I'll go to church with verbs,\nOf cold renowns, never screwed up,\nEven if you say I'm dumb,\nCall me the lost sheep that Jehovah found,\nI'm a soldier now, but sometimes I feel like I'm a only child,\nSo different, it's like I got a lonely style,\nFlow misfit, I feel like Kobe Howe,\nHe was ostracized,\nBut pass me the ball and on the court I'll rise,\nCall me pro-choice cause I'll vote all lies,\nThe mic's surging, so if you never heard my voice,\nShe isn't like Virgins,\nAnd these other rappers, they sorta like curtains,\nCause they be blocking the light, got the babies acting crazy,\nThey ain't rocking the right, I'm like the FAA,\nI be stomping their flights, G3's and G4's,\nSo you can go tell Jermaine and Leo,\nHe's more than an MC to Zendaya Friar,\nNine from the physical grave,\nI'm the God's mind in the physical cave,\nWith a general aim, to restore our original names,\nGotta live up for brains, so I can never be simple and plain,\nOrganic, I provide instrumentals for rain,\nFormatic, put these chemicals in your veins,\nExplore addicts,\nWelcome to my temple of pain, I'm from the cabinet,\nThe beat is Dick Cheney, the flow is Condoleezza,\nIt's so sick baby, you know I'm the bomb leaders,\nI diss all preachers, we got the wrong teachers,\nWe need new guidance, receive the true science,\nI feed like two lions, believe the true rhyming,\nLeave cause you lying,\nHe removed giants, the new Psalms of David,\nLiberate the mind from my songs on your playlist,\nThen ask yourself why you're not on the majors,\nThis is war music, they wanna calm the natives,\nRoll up your fist, raise your right arm and say this,\nWe will never lose because God is the greatest,\nWe will never lose because God is the greatest,\nWe will never lose because God is the greatest,\nWe will never lose because God is the greatest,\nYeah, Kelly Mays, Jussie Reacts, Pittsburgh's hands up!\n"}
