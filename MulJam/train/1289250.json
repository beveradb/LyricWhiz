This is not a miracle\nIt's how the wind can save me\nSnow is falling from the skies\nAnd we are dancing right in the middle of it\nI'm so crazy, I'm holding your hand\nI will change all the words that this evening told us\nWe're so happy, I can't even stand\nSo we fall through this whiteness and that's your surprise\nSnow is falling from the skies\nAnd we are dancing right in the middle of it\nLife is just a hypothesis\nI don't care if you watch\nSnowflakes under your feet\nTime goes on, let me show you the way\nWe can stay with these feelings\nFears are all gone\nWorld is changing day after day\nYou just try to remember when we are all\nSnow is falling from the skies\nAnd we are dancing right in the middle of it\nLife is just a hypothesis\nI don't care if you watch\nSnowflakes under your feet\n"}
