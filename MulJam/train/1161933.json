How do you do?\nCome on here, sit down, Grab a brew, join my crew\nI'm hoping you don't think that I am preachy or pompous\nI can promise you my intention was the opposite\nYou see I don't have much time to be talking about partying or drinking wine\nStill I'll tell you how I lost my money, Then I got it back with a soul clap\nAnd I'll own, Burn the incense, Rake the drones out, tone, get on the phone\nSpread the word, Get in the zone, Just cause birds of a feather\nCan fly through any weather, And I think it better\nIf we unite the tribe and do this forever\nArms like a little cheddar, Eat it all together\nMake a new gift to kinda me, Then forget about the past\nBe right, Think fast, Now put this track, On blast\nOn blast\nWhere my owls at? And where my gals at?\nAnd to the fellas, Where my pals at?\nI know you found that, I'm sure it was about that\nSee it through the darkness, And let me get a soul clap\nWhere my owls at? And where my gals at?\nAnd to the fellas, Where my pals at?\nI know you found that, I'm sure it was about that\nSee it through the darkness, And let me get a soul clap\nSo, burn the words\nGet in the zone\nBurn the words\nBurn the words\nBurn the words\n"}
