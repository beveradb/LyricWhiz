Put aside your kiss, your sin, your sympathy.\nWe shouldn't have to hide under the skin. Put aside your epidemic fate.\nNever drop the strings. Never lose faith.\nShouldn't judge the skin. The bully in kids.\nAlways have to hide under the skin. Put aside your kiss, your sin, your sympathy.\nWe shouldn't have to hide under the skin. Put aside your epidemic fate.\nAlways have to hide under the skin. Put aside your kiss, your sin, your sympathy.\nWe shouldn't have to hide under the skin.

Put aside your epidemic fate.\nLook under the skin.\nJust the ones look under the skin.\n"}
