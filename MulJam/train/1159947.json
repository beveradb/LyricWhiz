{"reasons": "Consistent lyrics;identical predictions", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "I did not pay attention the first time you told me\nWhat makes you think I'd listen now?\nYou tend to trap it is so very overblown\nWhat makes you think you'll like this time?\nYour fingers they are still dancing upon my lips\nBut they don't feel the way they did\nIt seems tomorrow we'll be dancing on another tune\nBut we don't know the title yet\nI don't care what you say anymore\nYou have fooled me a few times before\nAnd though my hands and feet they are sore\nIf you look for me I will be by the door\n\nReally shut down, play your parade of antics\nThere is no audience for you here\nPut on your war paint and do the routines as before\nBut don't expect another cheer\nI can see myself fall down so slowly\nI am getting wiser as I get lowly\nI do not want your arms around me\nI just want to get out of this house\n\nThe chilly wind will not deter me from the path I choose\nThe frost ahead of me is warmer than what I lose\nThe razor's edge is getting nearer and nearer to me\nWalking on thin ice is still better than remaining here\n\nI sometimes wish I never was born\nAfter such a long time feeling torn\nI got carried away by the storm\nAnd I will be better off alone\n\n"}
