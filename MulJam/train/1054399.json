God's lightning bolt has been lost\nNobody knows, nobody cares He found it on the way\nWhy don't you take it for yourself?\nWhat's back in the real world? All the power of the magic's gone away\nIt feels like a monday Life looks like a TV show\nLet's all go to cages And let the monsters roam down the streets\nHe's building a new world He's dancing on a rainbow stone\nGod's lightning bolt has been lost Nobody knows, nobody cares\nHe found it on the way Why don't you take it for yourself?\nGod's lightning bolt has been lost Nobody knows, nobody cares\nHe found it on the way Why don't you take it for yourself?\nTake it for yourself Take it\nHey, why don't you take it? Take it for yourself\nWhy don't you take it? Take it\nHey, why don't you take it? Take it for yourself\nTake it for yourself\nGod's lightning bolt has been lost Nobody knows, nobody cares\nHe found it on the way Why don't you take it for yourself?\n"}
