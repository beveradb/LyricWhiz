Because my heart still with its turn\nSo, cross and measure, eventual or gone\nAn inevitable farewell, a feeling that turns\nA constant dream that turns\nA feeling that turns\nA constant dream that turns\nNow we have to leave, understand it\nMy heart is here, fleeing\nNow we have to leave, understand it\nMy heart is fleeing to comfort\nFly, without a place to reach\nWhere you can't land\nNo clue to get up, without being able to scream\nWhere did my heart fall to escape?\nFly, without a place to reach\nIt's like asking me not to breathe\nIt's like joining me and in my heart\nTelling you to forget you\nImmediately, I act differently, unknowingly\nWrong, confused, and this you know\nIndifferent, when I talk I fall into oblivion\nEvidently, my guilt continues to haunt me\nOnly by mistake I cry in doubt\nFrom a moment this happened from being in dreams\nTo a nightmare, and without pill to heal the pain in my mind\nUnscrew, as for my emotions\nThat smile, that approach, a search for the stars\nAnd my feelings, I underestimate\nNow we have to leave, understand it\nMy heart is here\nNow we have to leave\nMy heart is fleeing from you\nLet me fly, without a place to reach\nIt's like asking me not to breathe\nIt's like joining me and in my heart\nTelling you to forget you\nNow I'm in a dream, and I'm not in a dream\nI'm in a dream, and I'm not in a dream\nI'm in a dream, and I'm not in a dream\nI'm in a dream, and I'm not in a dream\nNow we have to leave\nMy heart is here\nNow we have to leave\nMy heart is fleeing from you\nLet me fly, without a place to reach\nWhere you can't land\nWithout a place to call me\nWithout being able to scream\nI'm in a dream, and I'm not in a dream\nD-I-N-E-S\nD-I-N-E-S\nMy heart is fleeing from you\nLet me fly\n"}
