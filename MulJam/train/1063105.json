{"reasons": "consistency;minor differences", "closest_prediction": "prediction_2", "output": "From the garden, hear the clinging of the chimes\nThe last tomatoes, hanging shriveled on the vines\nThe autumn breeze is just a promise of the freeze that's coming soon\nThe season's fleeting, the days are blurring into years\nThe lines retreating, as every moment disappears\nThe stories end to leave another to begin to start anew\nAnd in a thousand years, when all our bones have disappeared\nAnd every word has been erased\nStill the rivers flow, the sun will glow, the seeds will grow\nThe wind will come and blow it all away\nCause we are just a memory replaced\nAll the deadlines have come and gone without a sound\nThe saddest headlines are now just pigments on the ground\nThe battles fought, the lessons taught, they all are lost now in the end\nAnd every secret you ever guarded with your life, the stars will keep it\nIf all the photons should arrive, we're just a speck in time and space\nJust a flag upon its face\nAnd in a thousand years, when all our bones have disappeared\nAnd every word has been erased\nStill the rivers flow, the sun will glow, the seeds will grow\nThe wind will come and blow it all away\nCause we are just a memory replaced\nFree yourself, release yourself\nThe burdens that you carry all will topple in the end\nAnd every bad decision that was weighing on your mind\nEvery failed mission, every ladder left unclimbed\nIt all just blows away\nAnd in a thousand years, when all our bones have disappeared\nAnd every word has been erased\nStill the rivers flow, the sun will glow, the seeds will grow\nThe wind will come and blow it all away\nThrough the centuries, the endless string of memories\nThrough the progress and the waste\nStill the rivers flow, the sun will glow, the seeds will grow\nThe wind will come and blow it all away\nCause we are just a memory replaced\n"}
