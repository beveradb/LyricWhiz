{"reasons": "consistency;coherent narrative", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "Walking on a desert road I was just singing an old sad song\nI was looking for a room to rest my bones Dreaming to meet someone who could fill my\nsoul I saw a cowboy come in with his black horse\nHold my hand and say I am the lord I was tired and the sun was hot\nI left him with his horse and I walked on In loneliness you'll always find your road\nIf you're lost you better walk alone\nNow the days almost gone I still haven't found a place to go\nI drank the last drop of the water stored Seated on a red stone by the road\nWhen I lit up a cigarette I thought That the end was near but I heard\nA guitar playing from afar It was a warm sound for my heart\nIn loneliness you'll always find your road If you're lost you better walk alone\nThat sound led me to a door That I could never open\nI opened the door of a big saloon called The Last Stop\nI had a drink, I kissed the girl And I sang with a man and his song\nA gunfire before I could talk I felt a burning air in my lungs\nThe man said to me to stay calm I finally found a place where I would rest my bones\nIn loneliness you'll always find your road If you're lost you better walk alone\n"}
