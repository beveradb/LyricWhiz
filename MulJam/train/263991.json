What does it mean? How is it possible?\nI dreamed this moment My head is sold alight\nAnd now the shiver I only tither\nExecute your fear Blinded by the rage\nNow you are in flames Now you are in war\nAshes and tears Born in flames\nNow you are the wind\nMaybe time is moving It's not the same thing\nI don't care how it's done Sometimes we can't choose\nYou or me Do you want to be a part of this moment?\nDo you want to give it away? Do you want to be?\nOr should we close our eyes And let our strenght\nCan hope truly be stronger Than hate and can forgiveness\nReally be a solution?\nNow you are in flames Now you are in war\nAshes and tears Born in flames\nNow you are the wind Now you are in flames\nNow you are in war Ashes and tears Born in flames\nNow you are the wind\nWhy do you manage me? Why me now?\nIs this another dream?\nI'm still surrounded To the end you can't stay\nWhy do I lose my dream?\n"}
