OK!\nWe go to the drive-in in my Chrysler\nIt is not my, it is sale of my Fazer\nWe watch her, we scrub and which one? Scream!\nWe bought popcorn, beers and ice-cream\nI have drunk so many, but Pfizer\nI've got nothing in my mind to fuck her\nOh, it's cool to be part of the USA\nBecause God bless the American way\nAnd this song is for you, Timberlake\nYou're my sweet little blow, motherfucker!\nWe go to the party on the beach\nThere is all the comfort we need\nWe're drunk, cause we're drunk, a couple of shots\nAnd we're high, because we like to smoke pot\nAnd I've tried to convince Timberlake\nTo make love on the beach, but she said\nI don't know, but you know, we don't know, no, no, no\nAnd we know, that you know, that's all I wanna know\nOh, it's cool to be part of the USA\nBecause God bless the American way\nAnd this song is for you, Timberlake\nOh, shut up!\nYou're my sweet little blow, yeah\nI don't want again!\nOh, it's cool to be part of the USA\nBecause God bless the American way\nAnd this song is for you, Timberlake\nYou're my sweet little blow, motherfucker!\n"}
