It's really more than I can bear\nSee the loneliness inside my heart It tears me apart, so let me impart\nI had to go Go away from you to comfort less\nTo start my life, my life again I had to go\nIt makes me sad to see you like this Your eyes are begging for a kiss\nLeaving you is best for us two Even though we're both feeling blue\nSee the loneliness inside my heart It tears me apart, so let me impart\nI had to go Go away from you to comfort less\nTo start my life, my life again I had to go\nAfter a year I see you again I feel you're near without any strain\nGoing away was the best for me and you See the loneliness inside my heart\nIt tears me apart, so let me impart I had to go\nGo away from you to comfort less To start my life, my life again I had to go\n"}
