{"reasons": "Identical lyrics in all predictions", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "The ones who led and lost their way The ones who followed went astray\nThey didn't find the light of day, hey\nTwisted by the new religion Brightened by the final vision\nCompromised by distant laws They found the key and lost the door\nSomething points me in a new direction And nothing changes at all\nNothing changes my chain of thoughts\nI've been talking to the trees They tell me you've been too lonely too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nFar too lonely for too long\nFamiliar faces tend to go I keep their names so that you'll know\nThe ones who loved you, loved you so, oh\nAn endless day that passed in minutes The scale of time that fell within it\nSweat dishes hands across your face And gouted lines that fall from grace\nSomething points me in a new direction And nothing changes at all\nNothing changes my chain of thoughts\nVoices whisper on the breeze They tell me you've been too lonely too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nFar too lonely for too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nSomething points me in a new direction And nothing changes at all\nNothing changes my chain of thoughts\nI've been talking to the trees They tell me you've been too lonely too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\nFar too lonely for far too long\n"}
