How much I miss your friendship\nOoh, sorry so I shouldn't have a doubt\nOoh, I shouldn't have a doubt Ooh, my friend\nTo the past time that we've known The magic that's still calm\nTo remember by your brow Cherishes whom it's for\nOoh, our paths will meet again Ooh, I'll be waiting for that day\nMy twin friend I've never had a doubt\nOoh, I've never had a doubt Ooh, I've never had a doubt\n"}
