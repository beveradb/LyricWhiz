{"reasons": "minor differences;consistent theme", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "\nAnybody stuck in a rut wants to break free\nI'm living my life but where the fuck will it take me\nI don't know but I keep going because there's two things that make me\nOne's my girl, the other's my little lady\nI wanna stand my own ground and make them both proud\nAnd give them both a better life, no doubt\nBut it's easier said than done\nSometimes I wanna run till my legs are dead and numb\nI'm tired of this hell, it's like swimming against the tide\nAnd most of the time I'm fighting myself\nBut it's a mental war\nLately feeling like I ain't got the strength no more\nLike I was meant to fall\nAnger's built up, it's mental war\nI need to stop trying to knock it down and rent some more\n'Cause it's causing me and the better half to argue getting harder\nAnd that's when the tension forms\n\nI'm walking a tightrope, feeling like I might go\nEven with the slightest the light blows\nDon't trust anybody that I know\n'Cause at this present time even my friends are like foes\nSo when the sun comes up\nI shout at myself in shadows and stay hidden till the light goes\nWherever I lay my hat, that's my home\nI leave it in the studio, yeah that's my zone\nMy place of expression, my release of aggression\nI find peace in the beat and I use my speech as a weapon\nKeeping myself at a safe distance\nHis rage is ready to spill as quick as a split instant\nPissed off to the point of selling my soul to the devil\nIt's like an extra weight that I don't want to hold\nPlus it's tainted with memories and negative energy like a cemetery\nPlus it's as dead as it's ever been\nMy bank balance, the most pitiful thing you've ever seen\nAnd my cash flow has never been ever green\nSpare change in a pocket full of holes\nLife's a game but there's never been a fair play referee\nAnd it gets to me, I'm just a man\nI wanna drape the streets concrete for sheer white sands\nThat's a pipe dream, blood to both ends\nIt's a show but there's no ovation when the show ends\nWith all profits on strings\nWaiting for the fat lady to sin\nSo we can open our wings\nWe keep faith for the hope that it brings\nI say we but mean you\nI don't go for those flings\nJust try and validify a city in the sky\nKnown as paradise\nWhere when the living die, they shall reside\nI don't do fairy tales\nI'm grown up\nI'll believe in that shit the day that Jesus shows up\nI'm grown up\nI'm grown up\nI'm grown up\n"}
