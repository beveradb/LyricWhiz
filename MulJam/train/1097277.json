Is this some silly dream?\nWill I suddenly awake, to find it some silly mistake?\nAs you cuddled close to me, your warm soft body comforts me.\nI could feel your strong heartbeat, with a rhythm so sweet.\nThen your perfume filled the air, as you gently touched my hair.\nCombing all my fears away, so no more tears for yesterday.\nWhy does my heart still miss a beat, each time we meet or speak?\nAnd when you're not here with me, I am lost and feel so empty.\nI was just about to speak, as a tear rolled down your cheek.\nAnd when you said you had to go, was like losing my own soul.\nThen you said with a warm smile, it will only be for a short while.\nAnd soon you'll be back with me, and stay for eternity.\nI thought angels only lived in heaven, but now you're here in my arms.\nI will make you so happy, and safe from all life's harms.\nAnd when we're old and gray, we'll remember how we feel today.\nWith our children by our side, full of love and full of pride.\nAnd when it's time to go to heaven, holding hands we'll go together.\nOur true love will see us through, then there will be just me and you.\nAnd what I will remember is, the memory of our first kiss.\nAs you drew your lips so close to mine, with a kiss so divine.\n"}
