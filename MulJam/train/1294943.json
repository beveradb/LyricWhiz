Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\nDashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh\nAll the fields we go laughing all the way\nBells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright\nWhat fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\nA day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride\nAnd soon this funny bride was seated by my side\nThe horse was lean and blank, misfortune seemed his lot\nHe got into a drifted bank and we, we go upside\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\nNow the ground is white, go it while you are young\nTake the girls tonight and sing their sleighing song\nJust get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty for his speed\nThen hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you'll take the lead\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\nHey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\nOh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh\n"}
