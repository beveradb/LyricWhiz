See I'm still in fire\nAll the reasons you're crossing all the clouds\nBut let it crash and burn away\nBut burn away\nSo fast and strong you choose, today you have no loose\nIt's time to get it all\nBut you're confused again, it must be the end\nNo power in your hands\nHow'd you want to die? See I'm still in fire\nAll the reasons you're crossing all the clouds\nBut let it crash and burn away\nBut burn away\nIt's gonna wake up, burn away\n"}
