Tell me, is this love?\nI really wanna know\nI watched your face this morning\nI saw your smile\nAnd I watched you yawning\nThen you scratched the wall\nI really wanna know\nIs this love? Tell me, is this love?\nI really wanna know\nI look into your eyes and I'm amazed\nThe light is dancing through your hair\nAnd I'm in a daze\nNow the snows are falling\nNothing's gonna be the same\nYeah, the frost, the frost is calling\nLet's go out to play\nIs this love? Tell me, is this love?\nOh, is this love that I'm feeling?\n\nIs this love that I'm feeling?\nIs this love that I'm feeling?\nIs this love?\n"}
