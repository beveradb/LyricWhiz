Unattractive paintings hang above the bed,\nsunbeams air filling through the sickness in your head.\nCan you hear me? Please open up your eyes.\nCan you feel me? Try not to cry.\nSitting here beside you, I wonder where you are.\nIf you'll remember me in the time I stole your car.\nI know it wasn't easy surviving twenty years,\nfinally you've given up confirming my worst fears.\nI know you're leaving, please open up your eyes.\nThis time I'm grieving, I don't want to say goodbye.\nKnew this was coming, it doesn't help my heart.\nSoon I know it'll never end, yet my world is torn apart.\nMiss you forever and the games we used to play.\nKnow you've made other plans and must be on your way.\nBut it's my birthday, please open up your eyes.\nIt's my birthday, I don't want you to die.\n"}
