I've got a tick-borne, it's eating me away.\nI've got a virus, it's eating me away. Yeah, it's eating me away.\nBut I, I'm gonna burn it all away. I'm gonna burn it all away. I'm gonna earn it all away.\nI'm gonna burn it all away. I've got some morphine, and it's killing all my pains.\nI've got some Xanax, it's keeping me sane. I've got some weed, it's fucking with my brain.\nIt's fucking with my brain. Yeah, it's fucking with my brain. It's fucking with my brain.\nBut I, I'm gonna burn it all away. I'm gonna burn it all away. I'm gonna burn it all away.\nI'm gonna burn it all away.\nI've got some cancer. And it's eating me away.\nI've got a tickworm. And it's eating me away.\nYou see, I've got a virus. And it's eating me away.\nSays it's eating me away. You see.\nBut I... I'm gonna burn it all away.\nI'm gonna burn it all away.\nI'm gonna burn it all away.\nI'm gonna burn it all away.\nI fucking burn it all away.\nI'm gonna burn it all away.\n"}
