Do you want to fucking feel?\nBut you can't\nYou bear such weight, this so-called healthy life\nYou do what the doctors say One dose each day\nWhere so much pain flows from our so-called life\nWell maybe it's time to change The choice that you can make\nYou can't go bigger, stronger, faster every day\nWith all you wanted and love strangled into grey\nDo you fight what's real? Do you want to fucking feel?\nBut you can't\nAnd on and on and on\nYou do what the teachers say You're strangled into grey\nAnd on and on and on\nYou do what the doctors say You're strangled into grey\nCome on\nCome on\nCome on\nCome on\nYou do what the teachers who don't want to teach us\nAnd do what the doctors who don't want to treat us\nAnd do what the preachers say\n"}
