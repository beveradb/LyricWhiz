But if you're gonna commit yourself\nWho are you in my homeland? Just a kiss in the fire\nAnd children run With the birds that sing for students\nAnd I reveal the magazine And no apple tree can fruit\nWith the police around Stand by your side\nAnd open hells to catch the clown And let it rather rain to come\nWe'll wash away and stop the mesmerizing Who are you in your homeland?\nBut if you're gonna commit yourself Who are you in my homeland?\nJust a kiss in the fire\nIt needs a little care to make a flower grow But it needs a day of life to make it finally bloom\nSmell of burn Deadly shames you're falling down\nLetting down the flame to come We rise my skin up to paradise\nAnd who are you in your homeland? But if you're gonna commit yourself\nWho are you in my homeland? Just a kiss in the fire\nJust a kiss in the fire\nGive a kiss in the fire\nJust a kiss in the fire\nGive a kiss in the fire\nGive a kiss in the fire\n"}
