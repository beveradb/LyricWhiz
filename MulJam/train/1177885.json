What does it even mean?\nWhy would anybody ever come between?\nAnd every time when the stars align\nThings are different but we're doing fine\nA little laugh, a little cry\nBut life goes on and we're still fine\nWhere do you come from? Where do you go?\nWe all come from somewhere, what do you know?\nSomebody thought a question, something you don't know\nMakes up for the lack of knowledge and you're free to go\nAnd every time when the stars align\nThings are different but we're doing fine\nA little laugh, a little cry\nBut life goes on and we're still fine\nLife is hard, no matter what\nNot always started with perfect cards\nSome people ever wonder, some people just ignore\nSome of them will never ever ever ever differ\nAnd every time when the stars align\nThings are different but we're still doing fine\nA little laugh, a little cry\nBut nothing more to say except we are fine\n"}
