Who will govern next?\nAn empire built on silk threads\nIn the end, I'm fine with the following\nAs long as you stay in the dark and the counter-way\nAnd shine in the city and the night in silence\nI'm caught in the city and its incandescence\nThe senses that run, slip through my fingers\nI won't hold it back, I'm a gambler\nAnd I lose everything I had of good\nIt's the mist that destroys me, I'm out of my mind\nWhen we don't understand, there's nothing but jealousy\nThe double feelings are not for those who smile\nI bleed from my veins, from my faults and my wrongs\nI bleed from my veins, from the snakes of remorse\nI'm going to burn down entire buildings\nTo remind me of the warmth you gave me\nAs much as you can watch paper planes crash\nWhat's left of it is over, no?\nI won't give you a name anymore\nAnd no more brawls, I won't give you my moments anymore\nAnd the rain won't go away like it did before\nThe wind will blow in our love center\nMay autumn burn and extinguish\nMay the dead leaves die and freeze\nTime changes men, makes women beautiful\nBut you're more than a chimera, I would have cut your wings\n"}
