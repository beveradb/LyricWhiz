All the things that we could see\nJobs can't be wrong, I know it's a way of life Imagine the world could change just with a simple song\nWe're the future, we're the youth We're a revolution, we're the new days that\nGo make the world shine bright again\nWe're the future, we're the youth We're a revolution, we're the new days that\nGo make the world shine bright again\nWe're looking for peace, we're looking for love We just wanna breathe, so let's believe\nWe're looking for peace, we're looking for love We just wanna breathe, so let's believe\nLet's believe\nLet's believe\nLet's believe\nWe're the future, we're the youth We're a revolution, we're the new days that\nGo make the world shine bright again\nWe're the future, we're the youth We're a revolution, we're the new days that\nGo make the world shine bright again\nWe're the future, we're the youth We're a revolution, we're the new days that\nGo make the world shine bright again\nShine bright again\nShine bright again\nShine bright again\n"}
