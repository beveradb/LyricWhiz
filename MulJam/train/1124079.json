Well, then how can I be forever lost?\nI've never been here and you've never seen me Stop calling on dawn\nI know you want it, I know you need it But I'm not the one\nSo promise me to live with the dawn Do it if I, do it if I, do it if I want\nIt's now or never, it's like the one last breath Before we drown again\nBut something's burning in my chest It's now or never, it's like the one last breath\nBefore we drown again But something's burning in my chest\nI've never been here and you've never seen me Stop calling on dawn\nI know you want it, I know you need it But I'm not the one\nSo promise me to live with the dawn Do it if I, do it if I, do it if I want\nPromise me to live with the dawn Promise me to live with the dawn\nPromise me to live with the dawn Do it if I, do it if I, do it if I want\n"}
