{"reasons": "more consistent and coherent lyrics; fewer repetitions", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "Can you miss what you never have known?\nAnd can you ache for a place that was never your home?\nNo misgivings or shame, like a moth to the flame\nTo burn up or fizzle alone\nCan you know who inhabits your skin?\nAnd can you trust that you won't blow away in the wind?\nAnd do you tether your hopes or let go of the ropes?\nIn the hope that you someday descend\nJust follow the road\nThe blood in your veins like a track for the trains\nThe heart always aims for the place where you belong\nJust follow it home\nThough it may not agree with the path that you seek\nSometimes you just need to stop searching and stand up and go\nJust follow the road\nCan a bird take flight in the sky\nWith no map and no compass for thousands of miles\nAnd just glide through the air on a wing and in prayer\nTill the day he finally arrives\nWhen the rain comes out of the clouds\nIt makes no decision to fall to the ground\nAs fate was ordained when the time came to rain\nThere's nowhere to go now but down\nJust follow the road\nThe blood in your veins like a track for the trains\nThe heart always aims for the place where you belong\nJust follow it home\nThough it may not agree with the path that you seek\nSometimes you just need to stop searching and stand up and go\nJust follow the road\nCan love exist unexpressed\nWith no way to show it to you in the flesh\nCan love exist unexpressed\nTo you in the flesh\nIf you follow the road till it leads you back home\nYou'll find that the answer is yes\n"}
