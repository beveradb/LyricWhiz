{"reasons": "correct lyrics;consistency;clarity", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "I take a trip down memory lane where everything is the same except a little more strange and\neverything's changing time slows down for a minute when we blazing\nthe feeling is amazing foot on the pedal and I'm never looking back\nstop the devil in his tracks now the sentiment is back\nit was simpler times for simpler minds let it rewind\nI've been a little bit ahead of my time but underneath the streetlights\nI can feel the city breathe with one in the air we can shoot the breeze\nI stepped it up a few degrees since I blew the trees\nwhen this really cold world bring a poet to his knees\nI believe in the memories ride through the bad ones\nstuck to the feeling light it up if you have one\nI'm closing in on my life I'm riding fly\nI'm closing in on my life I'm blazing twilight\nI got something to lose I'm on the road\ngive me a light I'm losing control\nI'm losing control\ntake a breath and watch the amber appear bloodshot from the last one\nnow my vision is clear we take you higher like a spliff to a roster lips\nshooting for the stars till they fall from the apocalypse\nstumble through metropolis accompanied by streetlights\nI'm wrestling with acapellas fall back and beat mics\nit's just a little something something make you weak feel better\nwho got five in a rap I wish this lasted forever my lungs ache\nso please give me a swig of the whiskey roll up another feeling\ntipsy from the jack and the sticky now we cruising through the city\nwith the windows down looking for fives while we ride\nwe don't need that now I know you've all had the feeling\nit's the rebel in us I spill my guts to the paper like I'm peeling the dust\nI take a clip to the face and start zoning let all my stress fade away\nwe're on a cruise and I'm cruising\nand I'm a ride or fly\nI'm losing my reasons why\nI got something to buy something on the road\ngive me a light I'm losing control\nand I'm cruising\nI'm cruising\n"}
