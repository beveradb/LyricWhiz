You know I can't be blind.\nI got it from a reliable source. Who got it from? Nobody knows for sure.\nEvery day the sun goes around the earth, the earth is the center of the universe.\nYou'd better not go too far, when you go out to sea you'll fall right over the edge. You'd better take it from me.\nI got it from a reliable source. Who got it from? Nobody knows for sure.\nNobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows for sure.\nNobody, nobody knows, nobody, nobody knows, nobody knows for sure.\nI got it from a reliable source. Who got it from? Nobody knows for sure.\nThe ministry of plenty says the future looks bright. The ministry of truth says there's a reason to fight.\nIt's because they hate freedom, it has nothing to do with something they want, and you know this must be true.\nI got it from a reliable source. Who got it from? Nobody knows for sure.\nNobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows for sure.\nNobody, nobody knows, nobody, nobody knows, nobody knows for sure.\n"}
