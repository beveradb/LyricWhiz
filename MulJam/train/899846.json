Now who looks a fool?\nLet me give you a clue, it's you, I always fucking stated that\nUnmistakably great from the very first day I fucking made a track\nNow you wanna take it back cause you can see me flaring up\nWhoops, there goes my middle finger, so shut up, I'm fucking hairy now\nI know how a vocal's supposed to flow, how to beat your bang and so on\nBetter get KD to rip it up with cynical, cynical's not the pinnacle and every single rhyme is critical\nYou hear that shit? Now we back the fuck away from the mic\nUnless you came to battle and better believe this, here's my F in life\nI don't do this for the money, yo, I ain't looking for fame\nI do it cause I love music, I got hip hop in my veins\nI bring that real shit back, I'm changing the game\nYo, it's corrupt dialect, remember the name\nI don't do this for the money, yo, I ain't looking for fame\nI do it cause I love music, I got hip hop in my veins\nI bring that real shit back, I'm changing the game\nYo, it's corrupt dialect, remember the name\nStick to this bullshit commercial rap, nothing worse than that\nFuck your chains, fuck your whips, fuck your Yankee fitted caps\nI was asked to dabble with that sound to prove I'm versatile\nSo I spurted some words, I murdered it, every verse is foul\nI'm a mic assassin, I ain't placid, I'm a savage beast\nThere ain't a single rapper on this planet that's outlasted me\nTake a chance to see, I dare you step to my level\nI'm forcing horns through my forehead, spawning the warrants for Dormand Daryl\nThere's very few of me, a truancy of true MCs\nHas made this game half of what it used to be\nThe rap music scene makes me spew till I'm oozing green\nFluid through my teeth into the streets for all of you to see\nWhen I spit a line or two, what you'll find is you get inclined to move your head\nTo a finer groove than what you're buying into on iTunes\nAnd if you don't like this, suck my dick, you didn't pay for it\nYou grabbed it off the internet, like a rabid dog, I gave you it\nI don't do this for the money, yo, I ain't looking for fame\nI do it cause I love music, I got hip hop in my veins\nI bring that real shit back, I'm changing the game\nYo, it's corrupt dialect, remember the name\nI don't do this for the money, yo, I ain't looking for fame\nI do it cause I love music, I got hip hop in my veins\nI bring that real shit back, I'm changing the game\nYo, it's corrupt dialect, remember the name\nI don't do this for the money, yo, I ain't looking for fame\nYo, it's corrupt dialect, remember the name\nCorrupt dialect, remember the name\nYou want the gossip\nCorrupt dialect, remember the name\nYou want the gossip\nCorrupt dialect, remember the name\nYou want the gossip\n"}
