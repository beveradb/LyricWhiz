Something went wrong a long, long time ago\nAnd it's a crying shame, it's a crying shame, it's a crying shame, it's a crying shame\nNobody is to blame, never found love before 15 minutes of fame\nWell this good time could do no wrong Through hard times I'd sing the happiest songs\nBut those are days all gone, long, long gone\nWith a broken neck and frayed strings I just can't play anything\nThat's the way it is\nSo at the end of the day I guess I'll throw it away\nAnd it's a crying shame, it's a crying shame, it's a crying shame, it's a crying shame\nI know that nobody is to blame, never found love before 15 minutes of fame\n"}
