{"reasons": "reason1;reason2", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "When all that's left of you is shredding lightly as a falter\nYou grab the money you amassed and take it to the altar\nAnd knowing then you make a sale, pass out the guy upstairs\nIt's always fun to realize the damage caps the repairs\nGather round your next akin and tell them to forgive you\nTake for granted every sin, be honored to outlive you\nBegging for indulgence, hoping they accept your credit\nBut in the end it all comes down to whether or not you get it\nGive your spoken widowed words to everyone's approval\nName your favorite tune and make them listen at your funeral\nSpend the minutes sitting in the silence of a heartache\nFinally the spell is lifted and thank God they're escaped\nAnd all of this emotional is a meaningless cleansing\nAnd now that I recall I wonder has it been worth spending\nOr do I feel uplifted or elated, free of desire\nOr maybe this ain't heaven and I'm preaching to the wrong choir\n"}
