Oh, yeah. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What they've got, dear fool. \n\n Your destiny is there. \n\n The crowd defies all who you care and answers. \n\n And answers. And answers. \n You're animal. And you. \n\n You're animal. And you. \n You're animal. And you. \n You're animal. And you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n I wake up now on a black floating cloud. \n\n I move forward slowly, where am I? \n\n It's the first time I feel the fear in me. \n\n Bugs disappear and I don't feel the same. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I seem to be a prisoner of your dreams. \n\n Prisoner of your dreams. \n I don't seem to love. \n You feel your feelings marching real fast. \n Wish your dreams are really, are really true. \n Wish your dreams are really, are really true. \n Wish your dreams are really, are really true. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
