If you're my muse, is my longing for adventure satisfied?\nIf you're my muse, is this dizziness produced by you alright?\nIf you're my muse, then you may stay I've been my muse\nIs this tinge of trembling due to your appointment as my muse?\nIs my confusion explained away by your function as my muse?\nIs my breathlessness the first step to creation? Then you may stay, I've been my muse\nYou enter my world in different shapes, at different stages\nYou make me act strange, I'm surprised every new time\nI don't get used to you, but you're essential It seems a part of me, of me, of me, of me\nI write your way, my words are magic And I'm only sorry for the time that you were gone\nBut I start writing something big, something strong that fills your place, something that stays\nWhen you're away, if that's your function Then you are guarded, you are protected\nYou are allowed to send shivers down my spine And for a moment to be mine\nYou confuse me and you amuse me And then you lose me, and then you lose me\nYou send shivers down my spine And for a moment you are mine\n"}
