{"reasons": "more consistent lyrics; better word choices", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "You're a roadkill, round the rudder hill Remind me not of just the word you say\nRemind me that it's all you say You're a roadkill, round the rudder hill\nSaw a rider down the west wing Big to small, it's like a hog rail\nYou're a roadkill, round the rudder hill Your bank is shaking, feeling\nGrabs me like you're bow steering You're a roadkill, round the rudder hill\nYour first stroke keeps me moving A slow hit when you're turning\nYou're a roadkill, round the rudder hill Remind me to hang on to the wheel\nCause danger hides in every heel You're a roadkill, round the rudder hill\nMake you light a hum of the engine Fuel injected turbo machine\nYou're a roadkill, round the rudder hill No traffic lights will hold you well\nNo red light will keep you still You're a roadkill, round the rudder hill\nYou're a roadkill, round the rudder hill You're a roadkill, round the rudder hill\nMany lights, taillights, street lights Put to the floor, we do the rest\nYou're a roadkill, round the rudder hill But I love you still, against my will\nYou're a roadkill, I'm lost in the hill I know that you will remind me\nThat's when you need finding\n"}
