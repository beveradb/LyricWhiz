I don't know but I've been told\nSince you left you were alone, how come?\nYou never showed up before, maybe you were occupied by the thought\nWhy did you appear?\nYou were alone in my hotel, walking towards me now\nEcstatic state of mind, rambles on at your sight\nAnd the whole grounds disappear, my thoughts are lost\nI can't speak anymore, the words won't ever come\nEvery smile pierced me, this time my heart's a deadly\nOn my mind you'll always be, nothing will change the way I feel\nI'm sure you understand, how we can't delay, or else we'll be strung out\n\nHell will not be here, not until tomorrow\nSo tonight we can be, whoever we will not be\n"}
