{"reasons": "More coherent lyrics structure; consistent verse separation; identical lyrics with prediction_1 and prediction_2;", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "I've reached the bottom of a deep black hole\nSlowly falling, I hear the calling in my soul\nAnd there to greet me was the frail voice\nThat beckoned sweetly and pulled me deeply toward the noise\nAll my life, following the call\nIgnore the price and wait to fall\nWhen everything you've loved is through\nThe only thing that's left to do\nIs follow any voice you hear and disappear\nIn the darkness reaching out my hand\nThe sound surrounds me and slowly drowns me out\nTime is slowing in, building tracks\nThe dreams are fading, the screams abating\nOne last chance\nAll my life, following the call\nIgnore the price and wait to fall\nWhen everything you've loved is through\nThe only thing that's left to do\nIs follow any voice you hear and disappear\n"}
