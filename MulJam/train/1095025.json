{"reasons": "All predictions have the same lyrics;", "closest_prediction": "prediction_0", "output": "Last time to listen, deep down in your soul Don't know you're giving time on the road\nThis time will be alright, come to realise Living games, playing life, colours of your mind\nLast time on the road, deep down in your soul A little lost on your own, time on the road\nLike a moon tide you go, come to realise Another day, another night, colours of your mind\nLost in a world of dreaming, goon sleep at night When the devil shows with a curse, mad towards your fight\nYou can hide in a maze, while you sin Fool and angel, son of the time, but never ever win\nFar honest and kind, cruel and blind Playing as a child, playing in your mind\nHere are the villains, a drunken haze of words No love, no reasons, the truth is but a blur\nI'm older, I understand, love will only grow The healing of the heart, importantly my soul\nMy chance to do some good, touch the heavens above So the gods can see, love will be enough\n"}
