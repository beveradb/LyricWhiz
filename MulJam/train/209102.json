Do you remember our first wish under shimmering sands?\nLight in your eyes, sparkling through your hair We were so free then, without a care\nAnd I wonder why you came here tonight And I wonder now when the morning comes\nWill you walk out when the morning comes?\nWhen the morning comes, will you walk out?\nNow I'm not sure what the future holds But thinking day by day don't wanna get too bold\nIf I could change things, you know I would too So we've got to forgive and move on through\nAnd I wonder why you came here tonight And I wonder now when the morning comes\nWill you walk out when the morning comes?\nWhen the morning comes, will you walk out?\nWhen the morning comes\nWhen the morning comes\nAh, ah, ah\n"}
