They should have warned us before it was too late\nDon't say a word because our peace has been taken The tents there are changing, the doors they are closing\nCould you feel the loss in your heart When the last days of summer were gone?\nCould you feel the emptiness I felt When the last days of summer were gone?\nOh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh\nDon't say a word because our peace has been taken The tents there are changing, the doors they are closing\nThey are closing\nCould you feel the loss in your heart When the last days of summer were gone?\nCould you feel the emptiness I felt When the last days of summer were gone?\nCould you feel the loss in your heart When the last days of summer were gone?\nCould you feel the emptiness I felt When the last days of summer were gone?\nWhen the last days of summer were gone\nWhen the last days of summer were gone\n"}
