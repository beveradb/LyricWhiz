It's about the utility of everything we do.\nIt's called To the South.\nThose wings were taken only to the lowly clouds where the air, too cold, failed him.\nThe vapors frosted on his feathers.\nHe fell, stiff but gasping, through a flock of seagulls that spread to give him way.\nHe could have lived if only he had flown closer to the sun.\n"}
