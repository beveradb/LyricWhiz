Closer.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nYou started waiting for a moment that never ends, Oh never ends.\nYou started waiting for a moment that never ends, Oh never ends.\nMoody is hot on a summer's night, The weather's warm and the feeling's right.\nSmell of summer's in the air, Thousand flowers everywhere.\nWaiting for the perfect moment.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nYou started waiting for a moment that never ends, Oh never ends.\nNow you're waiting for a moment that never ends, Oh never ends.\nThings can happen in the night, Things to keep your dreams alive.\nDreams of passion, dreams of love, Dreams to keep you holding on.\nI'm waiting. Come closer. I'm waiting. Come closer. Closer.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nWaiting. Waiting. Waiting.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nDancing through the waves of coolness, Listening to the sound of blue.\nWaiting for the perfect moment, Waiting for the touch of you.\nYou started waiting for a moment that never ends, Oh never ends.\nNow you're waiting for a moment that never ends, Oh never ends.\nGracias.\n"}
