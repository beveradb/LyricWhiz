{"reasons": "prediction_1 and prediction_2 have more consistent lines and accurate punctuation than prediction_0; both have very similar lyrics with only slight differences", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "All I need is a drink to embolden Give me a bottle of that and I'm golden\nHeat me up till I am molten Burn alcohol through you\nI won't be able to stop my tongue Won't recognize what I've become\nAnd when at last I've had my fun I'll have to sleep it all on\nBeginning to think that you are right About all the people afraid to die\nWe have no idea what heaven's like But we're terrified of heaven\nSo I decided to face my fears Cause I die a little each time you're here\nBut you always seem to disappear When I need you the most\nI was sober when I finally said the words But when I finished your face was blurred\nAnd there was something different about the world As I walked myself home\nSo take this bottle and drink it down Try to act cool as I look around\nBut it was then I wound to the ground Cause you burn alcohol through me\nAll I need is a drink to embolden Give me a bottle of that and I'm golden\nHeat me up till I am molten Burn alcohol through you\nI'll burn alcohol through you I'll burn alcohol through you\nI'll burn alcohol through you\n"}
