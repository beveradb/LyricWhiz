Tell me.\nWell, it's the second one I've had, but they're both the same.\nThey start out that I'm in here, but it's not day or night.\nIt's kind of half-night, but it looks just like this, except for the light.\nAnd I'm scared like I can't tell you.\nOf all people, you're standing right over there.\nBy that counter.\nYou're in both dreams, and you're scared.\nI get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are, and...\nThen I realize what it is.\nThere's a man in back of this place.\nHe's the one who's doing it.\nI can see him.\nI can see his face.\nI hope that I never see that face ever outside the dream.\nThat's it.\nSo, you came to see if he's out there.\nTo get rid of this God-awful feeling.\n"}
