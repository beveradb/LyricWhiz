We have used it in order to shorten the agony of\nwar, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans. We shall continue\nto use it until we completely destroy Japan's power to match war.\nNow when there's a war, they talk about innocent civilians. There are no innocent civilians.\nYou're doing something for the war effort. So there's no, there's no innocent.\nSo\nso\n\nNo, but I've seen pictures of Tokyo being burned.\nSame thing. Took longer. Same thing.\nNow, if you want to blame anybody,\nyou should blame your military for doing what they did.\nIt's a mass destruction, mass murder weapon.\nI think you, Mr. Agumon,\nas a scientist, know this very well.\nThe whole thing is bad.\nI was a pitcher. My catcher was Howard Erickson.\nHe was drafted. He was killed in Japan, fighting.\nThe whole thing was a mess.\nTo me, whether one dies from bullets or explosives\nor atomic bombs or regular bombs,\nwhen you die, you die, and it's just terrible.\nYou are, in a way, fortunate that you did survive.\nSo many people didn't survive,\nboth from our side of the world and your side of the world.\nMy friends died in Vietnam,\nand many of them were in the Philippines.\nI've been watching the Peace Memorial Museum since yesterday,\nand I've been listening to their stories.\nI don't think they understand the history of Hiroshima.\nIt was a terrible thing from the bottom of our hearts.\nI'm really sorry for the people who lost their lives.\nI'm sorry for the people who are still alive.\nI'm not happy.\nI just want to apologize.\nI didn't feel some sort of apology for this.\nNo way.\nPearl Harbor did it for me.\nI lost too many friends in Pearl Harbor.\nNo apology.\nI want you to think that I'm sorry.\nJapan, of course, made mistakes.\nMany countries made mistakes during the war.\nWe know what kind of weapons nuclear weapons are.\nThe nuclear industry is still killing the victims.\nWe will never, under any cases, have to resort to using nuclear weapons.\nIt would be absolutely irresponsible.\n"}
