I'm back to shine for you tonight.\nWaiting for the night to come out. Meet me if the clouds move out tonight. Feel it and shout it out.\nWaiting for the night to come out. Meet me if the clouds move out tonight. Feel it and shout it out.\nI want you to get busy with your body and throw down. The music gets you hyper. Crank the party up, get toned down.\nThe feeling just enjoy it. Groove it, rock it all night long. This is the final hour. Dance like it's the final song.\nI am the moon and the sun. I'm always on the run. I'm back to shine for you tonight.\nI am the moon and the sun. I'm always on the run. I'm back to shine for you tonight.\nI am the moon and the sun. I'm always on the run.

I'm back to shine for you tonight.\nSixteen, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\nWaiting for the night to come out. Meet me if the clouds move out tonight. Feel it and shout it out.\nWaiting for the night to come out. Meet me if the clouds move out tonight. Feel it and shout it out.\n"}
