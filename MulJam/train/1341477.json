And she says keep your cool\nBut it's midnight, you Who you trying to fool?\nYou live your life in fear Wish the end was here\nIt's running too I just pass the time\nKeep the pale post by And it's sad but true\nI think about those good times They were few but who's crying?\nStop believing them over Smile and pretend\nThe fear's in your head The pill's in your hands\nAnd you're taking them over And over and again\nI'm screaming for help, people shouting What's coming on you?\nAnd she says keep your cool But it's midnight, you\nWho you trying to fool? You live your life in fear\nWish the end was near It's running too\nI just pass the time Keep the pale post by\nAnd it's sad but true\n"}
