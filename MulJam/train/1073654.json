Oh, boundaries disgrace.\nTiming.\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\nIt is a Word. It is just a fucking Word.\nAnd God was a useless intuition. The intuition of love and sense and meaning.\nIt is a variable of nonsense.\nWe are going to hate doing it.\nNormally it is a good job.\nIt is a secret.\nLet love let die. It is a fragile matter.\nBe aware of the distance in love. Don't let love approach so carelessly, so relentlessly, so divided.\nIt is a form of terror. It is a form of knowledge. It is overwhelming.\nShould we take love to its final consequences?\nA rope is as good for death as for the preservation of love.\nFor false is fair. I am forgotten, then by leave.\nOr how can love never show?\nIs that man's gaze to all women?\nPretends a man called famously.\nOut, I don't care.\nFor such as can't run between, love I forswore.\nIt's a world of love and fear.\nGod is a discourse. Regardless of its meaning, God is a form.\nBe aware of the distance in love. Don't let love approach so carelessly, so relentlessly, so divided.\nFascinated by its latitudes, don't let love pay your bills, nor your taxes, nor your feathers.\nBe aware of the constant invocation of love and surrender.\nBe aware of the delicate kisses, the course of knowledge, the litanies of orgasm.\nOh, consequence of gravity, busted egoism.\nShall we kill the under a massive catastrophe of fire and recognition?\nOh, boundaries disgrace.\nOh, consequence of gravity.\nOh, subtle illness.\n"}
