Where is he? I listen to every sound.\nBut it's just the silence of the night playing games with my mind.\nThe candlelight flickers moving shadows on the wall.\nAs I peer through the window my warm breath mists up the glass.\nThe silence of the dark waiting to hear the sound of his footsteps.\nThe silence of the night as I sit here in the candlelight.\nThe only sound I hear is the sound of my heartbeat.\nAs I wait for him the rain begins to fall.\nThe silence of the dark waiting to hear.\nThe silence of the night as I sit here.\n"}
