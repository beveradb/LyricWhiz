Anything.\nI need to know patients, possible test subjects.\nLook, I've already told all that I know to the interviewers, the papers, and the police.\nIf you want to know more, just go look it up online like everybody else.\nI was hoping you could be a little more specific.\nDo you know anything about memory manipulation, memory recovery?\nThere were a number of experiments dealing with memory recovery.\nOne particularly promising subject was going to be the key to a medical revolution\ndealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSo what happened?\nSomething went wrong, of course.\nDoes it have anything to do with this?\nI thought I'd never see one of these again.\nIt's a first stage prototype.\nIt's got data coded inside of it.\nIt's designed to tell when it was used, what it was used for, and for whom it was assigned.\nBut you should know that already.\nWhy should I know that?\nBecause all synchro subjects know what that device is.\nI've never been a patient of yours.\nAre you sure?\n"}
