I feel your head, I feel you eyes\nStrong enough Why you're a shy sky?\nI feel your head, I feel you eyes Strong enough\nThere are many secrets inside your head I show you my dream, you can't tell me more\nThere are many hopes inside your mind I show you smile so you can tell me more\nYou can tell me more You can tell me more\nI did smile with you Please don't forget\nI wanna catch the time and now I wanna know\nWhy you're a shy sky? I feel your head, I feel you eyes\nStrong enough Why you're a shy sky?\nI feel your head, I feel you eyes Strong enough\nThere are many secrets inside your head I show you my dream, you can't tell me more\nThere are many hopes inside your mind I show you smile so you can tell me more\nYou can tell me more You can tell me more\nThere are many secrets inside your head I show you smile so you can tell me more\nYou can tell me more There are many hopes inside your mind\nYou can tell me more\n"}
