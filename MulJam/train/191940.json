I watch my face of the Egyptian goddess, and taste a ghost that I can't touch.\nSo he scans the grid, clearing one section at a time, sorting by relevancy, words and pictures come and go, the dogs return with nothing, the case is closed, cold, but I can't let go.\nI draw circles around the place where you were last seen, they call the house, but I answer rings, I write letters, return to cinder.\nI call for you, but you never answer.\nAnd so I sit in my lowest position, my spinal light beckoned for the truth, and the truth is that I can't bring you back.\nI help a spot on the path with my slightly downward knees, my cup hangs over the emptiness, my breath is lifeless, and I am free to go wherever my city takes me.\nAnd so I sit in my lowest position, my spinal light beckoned for the truth, and the truth is that I can't bring you back.\nI help a spot on the path with my slightly downward knees, my cup hangs over the emptiness, my breath is lifeless, and I am free to go wherever my city takes me.\nTo plant the seeds of tomorrow, watered with the drain of forgiveness, soaked in the light of attachment, the seasons come and go, one day you bear fruit, the next day your branches are bare, if through at all, you remain wrapped in radiance.\n"}
