Would you go and leave me?\nWould you come and take my hand?\nHave I ever told you That I need to hold you?\nBut I'm scared that you might cry\nI could break you And you could break me too\nSo we stay on separate sides\nIf I told you nothing Then could you believe in something?\nWould it make you feel strong?\nIf I thought I could win Then I would try again\nTo satisfy the lust For a knowing built on trust\nUnderstanding from within\nHave I ever told you I need to hold you?\nBut I'm scared that you might die\nI could break you And you could break me too\nSo we stay on separate sides\nIf I had a second For every love mislaid\nI could give you a lifetime Of all the dreams I'd saved\nI'm lost for words to say About the way I feel\nAnd that's the closest I can get\n"}
