Yo, yo\nNow we make pop songs, but I'ma still get my rap on\nLike Bar Soul, Hot House in the sun, home, be gone\nYou can never dethrone the lamest in the game, the illest in my city\nIf I'm not, you must be insane\nI'm off my rocker, no, I'm out of my brain\nI've been killing competition since I was 13, and you have been warned\nCause with this pad and this pen, I think I'm ready for war\nI got bars for the swarms, and I'm so overboard\nLike I done stepped over the game of life, I'm so overboard\nLike I don't walk the million planks, I think I'm so overboard\nBoard bars, one more, like I'm sick of staying here, nigga, I'm so overboard, doubt this\nNow I can shake the whole spot down, split the whole world around\nDigs impact in the game, forget the backgrounds, lyrics make that gun sound like\nHottest in the game, hottest in the city, hotter than six big chicks in a blue span with me, send me autoclip rounds\nAnd I won't stop, and class won't either, until I have the rap game, making that J face after hearing Aether\nIt's the rap gamer, and the edgy J. Bieber, so if you too busy doing, then we don't need you, cause I'm so overboard\nLike when you cutting veggies up, I'm so overboard, like standing on a corporate meeting, I'm overboard\nBoard bars, one more, like a Saturday detention, nigga, I'm so overboard, doubt this\nWe're switching up now, bringing you the new me, don't doubt this, honestly don't we eat you, it all means that, we can see that, you don't like that, we say take that\nYou don't matter, like rainy weather, we make sunshine, to change forever, make the jazz masses mad cause we use 808s, make you mad cause I could be mixed to your world, don't doubt us\nYou better trust, we are the thrust, to chase the fuss, don't doubt us\nHaters come out, but damn, you make me sick, and the skies were blue, but damn, you make it rain"}
