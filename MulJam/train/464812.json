Come and answer me.\n4 You have brought us out of Egypt, redeemed us from the land of slavery.\n5 On the journey we have seen your hand.\n6 You want so much more than just a sacrifice, to reach out to the poor,\n7 a justice in our time.\n8 I must stop passing by the hungry eyes you send my way every day.\n9 Mercy is the choice I make. Help me be a mercy-giver.\n10 What shall I bring to you, O Lord? How shall I bow down before you?\n11 Shall I come with sacrifices, giving you my best?\n12 God has shown me what is good, and I can say that I know what he wants.\n13 But what he wants is acting justly, loving, and walking humbly.\n14 And you have God calling to the city, either you are the one who made it or you bear the scorn of nations.\n1\n2 Are you forgiving me for so much? Cancel all the debt I owed you.\n3 I could not make a single payment, and you just let it go.\n4 I should go and do the same thing, forgiving all the sins against me,\n5 spreading love and giving mercy and justice to the poor.\n6 You have brought us out of Egypt, redeemed us from the land of slavery.\n7 On the journey we have seen your hand.\n1 We want to give you more than just a sacrifice, to reach out to the poor,\n7 a justice in our time.\n8 I must stop passing by the hungry eyes you send my way every day.\n9 Mercy is the choice I make.
