Bryan, born at Cap-Haitien\nNo one can stop my mission of leading the world in this nation\nI'm an artist, a leader with a righteous vision\nFor all the good stuff that I've seen, paradise is no longer a dream\nIt's right here in my city, don't believe God displayed a griot\nCome sweet Creole, hey, say, we are together\nThat's right, you gotta love my country So one more time, say, we are together\nCome experience the spiritual growth Under the red and blue, from the beach to the mouth\nAnd we make you discover the treasures in you\nThat's my country yo, I'm king of my country yo\nThat's my country yo, I'm king of my country yo\n"}
