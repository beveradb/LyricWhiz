Is it time to say goodbye? Is it time for both of us to lay down and die?\nIs it time for waiting? Is it time to say goodbye? Is it time for both of us to lay down and die?\nIs it time for waiting? Is it time to say goodbye? Is it time for both of us to lay down and die?\nIs it time for both of us to lay down and die? Is it time for both of us to say our goodbyes?\nIs it time for both of us to lay down and die? Is it time for both of us to say our goodbyes?\nBye bye\n"}
