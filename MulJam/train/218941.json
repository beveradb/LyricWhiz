The NATO alliance deterred the Soviet Union.\nIt provided the time and space for free peoples to defeat communism.\nAnd it brought the Cold War to a bloodless end.\nAmerica will consult closely with our friends and allies at every stage.\nThere can be no lasting security in a world at the mercy of terrorists.\nFor my nation or for any nation, we will defeat the enemies of freedom.\nNow we have a great opportunity to build a Europe whole, free, and at peace.\nWith this grand alliance of liberty at its very core.\nThat work has begun by bringing in new members with extended security and stability\nthrough Central Europe. By establishing the partnership for peace,\nwe reached out across Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia.\nBy our actions in the Balkans, we halted ethnic cleansing in the heart of Europe\nand halted the dictator in the process.\nAmerica will consult closely with our friends and allies at every stage.\nThere can be no lasting security in a world at the mercy of terrorists.\nFor my nation or for any nation, we will defeat the enemies of freedom.\nYet there's more to do. We must strengthen our alliance, modernize our forces, and prepare for\nnew threats. We must expand cooperation with our partners, including Russia and the Ukraine.\nAnd we must extend our hands and open our hearts to new members to build security for all of Europe.\nNext year we meet in the ancient capital of a new democracy, our ally. Prague will host our\nnext summit in November of 2002. In preparation for that meeting, we must affirm our enduring\ncommitments by preparing for the challenges of our time. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nWe will defeat the enemies of freedom.\n"}
