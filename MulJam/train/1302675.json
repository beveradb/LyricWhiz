Well, French kisses and cat hair is one of them\nA single thing, a single thought, that I've caught, often is worth little on its own\nWhen day and night, oh then by chance, get our hands on something to really set the tone\nAnd there's those nifty combinations that enchant me, and probably will please you too\nOh nifty combination, what would be such a gem? Well, French kisses and cat hair is one of them\nOne thing is true, right away it makes my day, and so I say I'm not gonna live without\nAnd there's those nifty combinations that enchant me, and probably will please you too\nOh nifty combination, what would be such a gem? Well, French kisses and cat hair is one of them\nOh nifty combination, what would be such a gem? Well, French kisses and cat hair is one of them\n"}
