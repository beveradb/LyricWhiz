{"reasons": "Clarity in lyrics in the passage", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "I cannot tell you how it was, but this I know it came to pass\nUp on the bright and sunny day, when May was young a pleasant May\nAs yet the puppies were not born, between the blades of tender coir\nThe last egg had not touched us yet, the rainy birdwork on its net\nI cannot tell you what it was, but this I know it did but pass\nIt passed away with sunny May, like all sweet things it passed away\nLeft me old and cold and gray\nAnd old and cold and gray\n"}
