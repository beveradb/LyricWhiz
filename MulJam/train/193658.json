{"reasons": "word_consistency", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "Set adrift in this sea of unconsciousness All alone with no strength to resist\nThe thoughts that I missed Fade away from my conscious existence\nI'll stray, bobbing along in a boat of today With oars made of brain\nAnd the stars, they help me know where I am And my past, it leads the way\nRow and row, the harder I paddle the slower I go\nEddies and currents carry me in their flow They're all I can know\nAnd if morning comes to sun once again I'll burn this shallow wave away\nRise and shine, leave that timeless ocean behind Get caught up in the world that you\nfind Something real for your mind\nHope and pray, push and shove your way through the day\nKnowing that you won't have to stay You'll soon fade away\nAnd with the evening comes the stars once again Navigate into the sea\n"}
