{"reasons": "identical predictions", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "We are almost absolutely totally dependent on oil for all of our activities.\nFirst of all, industry of course runs on oil.\nEveryone understands that.\nAgriculture, mechanized agriculture to feed the world is heavily dependent on oil.\nIf you look at transportation, again, it's obvious.\nCars and planes run on oil, petroleum, gasoline.\nAnd of course military capability.\nYou can't fight a war, as Americans know, without oil.\nSo every aspect of human existence is dependent on oil.\nAnd when we reach that point, when we get to maximum production,\nmaximum supply capacity relative to demand,\nthat is a very significant point which many people think, including me,\nis without precedent in human history.\nThe evidence for people is absolutely overwhelming.\nFirst of all, we're discovering less and less new oil fields.\nVirtually four-fifths of the oil that we're now consuming\ncomes from fields discovered before 1970.\nThe opportunity to find new oil becomes limited to small pockets\nwhich are more difficult to extract and more costly.\nWe are now assuming each year three times more and more extra oil we're discovering.\nAnd that gap is widening.\nThe climate itself is not really a serious crisis.\nBut as the financial community wakes up, the growth is no longer possible.\nAnd Mr. Prime has not only started, but it's going on.\nIt's not just a full downturn. It's the beginning of a new age.\nAnd this could cause quite a shock.\nI mean, it could cause resource wars for people to try and get access to what is left.\nIt could, I think, personally, probably influence the second Great Depression.\nSomehow we've got to wipe out those mountains of capital.\n"}
