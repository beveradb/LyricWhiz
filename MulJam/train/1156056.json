{"reasons": "Consistent lyrics; fewer errors;", "closest_prediction": "prediction_2", "output": "I've been drinking too much whiskey I don't sleep through the night these days\nAnd I curse the world at every given chance Lessons I've been learning\nAs my knees give way beneath me I get up if I could but I just can't\nAll my former vices and a few I've just adopted What's the use of fighting all them now?\nIf I can't be the person that you always want to be with\nWhat's it even matter anyhow?\nAnd the sad reality is now I swim just not to drown\nBut the nights are so much longer I see you when I close my eyes\nSee, lately I'm just speaking in cliches To relive when I love you\nTo wake up one more time with you I would trade a thousand future days\nMoments shared together Moments I hold dearly now\nThat no one else will ever get to see But now you're still in silence\nAnd you won't say those words again At least I know you won't say them to me\nAnd the real tragedy is you were the best I'll ever see\nI boxed up all your letters And every piece of you that's left\nI burned them in a fire I had no choice\nEvery street of this town The fig trees and the pop shops\nThey tease me and they taunt me with your voice\nI don't know about forever But I can say with certainty\nThat I'll be here in case you change your mind\nSomehow through this darkness Through this all-sucking sadness\nA stupid piece of hope says we'll be fine Why can't I shut it up?\nCause I know it only lies\n"}
