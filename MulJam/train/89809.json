Are you free about me?\nWatch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet\nThat I know Watch the flowers, how they grow\nGoing down me on these feet\nNot much talking what will be And I know has to come\nA kingdom of lust It costs not to fear, to fear\nI know there's so much more How can we feel, how low?\nWatch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet\nThat I know Watch the flowers, how they grow\nGoing down me on these feet\nWatch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet\nThat I know\nWatch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet\nThat I know\n"}
