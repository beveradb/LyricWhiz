I'm just a lonely old clown\nIn a smoky old lounge in a broken old town by the sea\nAnd the townies and the tourists line up and knock on down and they talk about the good old days with the new best friends they found\nAnd they make a lot of promises but they never stick around\nAre alone enough to see right through the smile hanging over my brow? I'm just a lonely old clown\nInstrumental\nAnd the karaoke singers, I sing inside the lonesome song about the one who got away and the one who got it wrong\nAnd I can see it all from my place on the wall but I never make a sound\nIs there anyone who can see right through the smile hanging over my brow? I'm just a lonely old clown\nIn a smoky old lounge in a broken old town by the sea\nAnd I'm always looking around and I'm lost and found cause I'm nowhere around, oh lonely me\nCause I'm nowhere around, oh lonely me\nInstrumental\nApplause\nThank you, buddy\n"}
