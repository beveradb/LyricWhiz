{"reasons": "prediction_1 and prediction_2 are very similar with small variations; prediction_0 is less coherent", "closest_prediction": "prediction_1", "output": "I'm consciously slowly dying from all the shit that I'm seeing\nMannerisms out the window, no grips on my mental being\nTemptation consumes life like the garden it needed\nDeceiving thoughts of the children and music turns them to demons\nWon't believe it, searching for light inside of the darkness\nA rich man becomes homeless, falls asleep on a park bench\nForces the world around to move us and shake us\nAt that moment in time, asking Jesus to save us\nThe abyss continues to grow, just take a look at the earth\nWhile we're all intertwined somehow in the universe\nI fight till my hands bleed, over the page steady slaving\nAnd scream my beliefs till my lungs ready to cave in\nA glorified soldier in this war called life\nI can't rest tonight, my only weapon here is my mic\nAlways trying to reach the world, but it's easy to miss\nSo I ride for the cause hard, till I cease to exist\nI know there's something in the dark, and it's missing\nOnce you go far the lights will surely stop\nAnd you'll realize it's not wise to go looking in the dark\nDon't you go looking in the dark\nCause you're not been there with your mind and your thoughts\nIt's not been there\nLeave it alone, leave it alone\nOnce you go far the lights will surely stop\nIt's not been there in your mind and your thoughts\nPlease leave it alone\nSpeak of the shadow puppets I'm scanning\nI've had enough of this shadow that hovers over my head\nThat I hang low\nIt's taking over me uncontrollably, quotably\nI'm everything I hoped to be, if only they would notice me\nThey shifting, they changing, they rearranging\nStrangers I've been juggling my anger\nThe loneliest cliffhanger\nForever be continued, disappointed on the menu\nAnd it's dinner time, pipe dream\nChained it from a little dream\nNot the machine that manufactured the dream\nHand it back to him, scream\nI'm still trapped in the scene\nOriginal, invisible poet\nFlow with the stream, echo with the unknowing\nAnd show them they never seen\nLeave it alone, leave it alone\nNo, oh, oh\nThings are hidden for a reason\nDon't think you have the right\nTo go lurking in the dark\nWho do you think you are?\nNo, oh, oh\nLurking in the dark\n"}
