We call these warp songs If you if you hear well with your ears Then close your eyes and I'll play some of these different instruments and see if you can tell me what they are. Remember, this one sounded like a flute. But we're not quiet all of the time. You're, you're, you're, you're not. No, we know there are times and places to be quiet and other times and places when we can make noise if we want to. We make all the noise we want.
