Everything I did alone I won't leave you to them oh Every time I was in pain You were always on my heel oh Cause you can't see me For everything you have done I will only feel your heart oh Even when you start to shine I will never stop to love oh Cause you did to me Because you're right, you've always been The only thing I know is You can't love for real Honey For all you feel, you're always right I wish I could have done once At least in my life Looking more deeper inside Baby, never stop to be You're a perfect now to me oh If I could not shake your heart I would only see your love oh Cause you're right like that People love me for my hair Or anything I could give oh But you are good at someone There is no reason of love oh Cause you love that scene Because you're right, you've always been The only thing I know is You can't love for real Honey For all you feel, you're always right I wish I could have done once At least in my life Looking more deeper inside Because you're right, you've always been The only thing I know is You can't love for real Looking more deeper inside inside
