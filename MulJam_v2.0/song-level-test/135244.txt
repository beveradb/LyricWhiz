So long we've passed as strangers.  When we once were friends So strange to hear your voice now.  After all we'd said And I didn't call to say I need you.  I just called to say I finally found my lifeline.  It's my wedding day.  So long since we were lovers And you shed my bed.  So sad we had to let go Of those dreams we'd shared.  But I didn't call to hear I love you I just hoped you'd say.  You're glad and so proud of me It's my wedding day.  It's my wedding day. Since so long to what we thought of I finally found my prayers.  So much of what we fought for Seems like yesterday. And I didn't call to say I love you I just called to say.  I finally found the one I've looked for It's my wedding day.  It's my wedding day
