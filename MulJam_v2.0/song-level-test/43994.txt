Down is the short dark day Now here's the first smell of ashes.  The reason ice breaks away The dreadful water flashes.  Seawater mountain rides And down is green size.  A foamy torrent dashes.  My ship is moored for thee By the deep ocean's floor.  And then we'll skim the sea Drifting amongst fears we ignore.  We'll go on this tiny island Where the sun warms the sand.  Resting our light heads beside the shore.  I'm gonna wait for you While the four winds blow.  With dreams and flowers Go alone and fair.  Rite up on the island of snow I imagine you floating there.  And when red skies and burning clouds Will bespeak the end of summer.  When mountains will rush rise Of snow and mountain roar.  We'll settle down Our sailing minds.  And with that be A winter midnight's behind.  Thanks for watching!
