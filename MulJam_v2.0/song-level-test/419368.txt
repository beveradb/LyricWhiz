My heart's at work, trying to find words How can I be so lucky that you love me? My hand's at play, trying to find a way To never let your fingers slip Oh, I'll miss the soft lips Cause I won't go where your heart can't follow I won't sneak away at night, baby, you're my life Your hips are a mystery, I'll pull them close to me Put your arms around my side, I'll keep you close tonight Tonight Cause I won't go where your heart can't follow I won't sneak away at night, baby, you're my life Oh, you're my rain and shine I can't believe that you're mine I love you more than any song that can be sung Any prize that can be won More than stars I try to gleam More than nights that I can dream Oh, I thought I would fall apart But you picked up pieces of my heart Get them close to yours Every day it seems I love you more I love you more than life I love you more than life Cause I won't go where your heart won't follow I won't sneak away at night, baby, you're my life Cause I won't go where your heart can't follow I won't sneak away at night, baby, you're my life
