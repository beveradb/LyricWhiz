Walking the street these lonely nights Under the shadows of these lights Feeling so cold outside inside I look for a place to stay Where I could rest all my life I know the sun will shine again in my life Life must go on I know the sun will shine again in my life Life must go on Life must go on Leaving this world off again like Other place in world I feel burns Trying the dreams we have tried to keep alive I feel so sad I feel so tight Where could I rest the rest of my life I know the sun will shine again in my life Life must go on I know the will shine again in my life Life must go on I know the sun will shine on again in my life Life must go on I know the sun will shine on again in my life Life must go on Life must go on Guitar Solo Guitar Solo I know the sun will shine again in my life Life must go on I know the sun will shine again in my life Life must go on I know the sun will shine on again in my life Life must go on I know the sun will shine on again in my life Life must go on Life must go on Believe in life, believe in love In the name of the Lord Believe in angels, believe in ghosts And save your soul
