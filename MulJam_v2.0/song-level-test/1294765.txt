My diary's on the ground, trying to catch my attention Risen thoughts never die, crystallized on the pages They will knock at the door if you try to forget them It doesn't make sense to dwell on the past Cause I'm not the one I used to be It doesn't make sense, cause life goes so fast Would you burn this for me? I had to change the past with my imagination Trying to forget the worst, justifying my actions Should I switch on the light? Should I face all my regrets? It doesn't make sense to dwell on the past Cause I'm not the one I used to be It doesn't make sense, cause life goes so fast Would you burn this for me?
