I am not afraid of you I await my moment patiently I'll initiate my coup Before you abdicate to entropy I'll make you wish you'd never been born I'll make you wish you'd never been born And all of this will turn to rust Just as soon as the rain has dried Your creations will combust When at last my voice is amplified I'll make you wish you'd never been born I'll make you wish you'd never been born The ground will shake, the veil will be torn I'll make you wish you'd never been born You haven't seen the last of me Sharp in my teeth, digging in deep I'll make you Thank you for watching!
