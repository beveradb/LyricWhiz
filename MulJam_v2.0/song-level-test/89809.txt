Come on out here to this place Where it feels, where it feels.  For millions there's no need to say How they feel, how they feel.  And another that tells me How I feel in my days.  Are you sure about yourself? Are you free about me?.  Watch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet.  That I know Watch the flowers, how they grow.  Going down me on these feet.  Not much talking what will be And I know has to come.  A kingdom of lust It costs not to fear, to fear.  I know there's so much more How can we feel, how low?.  Watch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet.  That I know Watch the flowers, how they grow.  Going down me on these feet.  Watch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet.  That I know.  Watch the flowers, how they grow Going down me on these feet.  That I know.
