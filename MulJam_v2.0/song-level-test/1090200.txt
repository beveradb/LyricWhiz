\u266a \u266a The silence of the dark waiting to hear the sound of his footsteps. The silence of the night as I sit here in the cold night air. Sometimes the wind blows through the trees with just the sound of falling leaves. Sometimes the owl calls out through the night like a long lost soul. As the darkness gently falls the candlelight glows. The silence of the dark waiting to hear the sound of his footsteps. The silence of the night as I sit here listening for him. The moon shines through the window casting shadows on the wall. Nothing moves except the field mice running swift across the floor. As the coldness bites into my body I listen for him. Is he coming? Where is he? I listen to every sound. But it's just the silence of the night playing games with my mind. The candlelight flickers moving shadows on the wall. As I peer through the window my warm breath mists up the glass. The silence of the dark waiting to hear the sound of his footsteps. The silence of the night as I sit here in the candlelight. But the only sound I hear is the sound of my heartbeat. As I wait for him the rain begins to fall. The silence of the dark waiting to hear. The silence of the night as I sit here.
