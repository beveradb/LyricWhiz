You said you needed some space between us Well maybe I took it a little too far And now I've gone where you cannot follow We don't even see the same stars And I am slightly short of breath There's not enough oxygen in this atmosphere And I can barely take a step Because I know I am the first one to walk here So breathe in me, breathe in me The sky is green But the ground is blue And this place is the opposite of you And I am slightly short of breath There's not enough oxygen in this atmosphere And I can barely take a step Because I know I am the first one to walk here And I left you on earth behind Because I could not stand to stay and face the truth Now every footprint that I've left Will be a trace of how I kept my love from you So breathe in deep, breathe in deep Breathe in deep Breathe in deep Breathe in deep Breathe in deep Breathe in deep
