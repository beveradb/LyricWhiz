Got rusty hinges on the bulkhead door There's miles of cable scattered on the floor Sometimes the only way to tell day from night is The solitary shouts of life But there's only one window about head high You can spend three days there in the blink of an eye Outside all you hear is the rattling, shaking To walk on by is a dangerous thing From my basement, from my basement I can't see the world through my basement From my basement, from my basement I can't see the world through my basement Nothing precious, nothing to steal There is no telling what's really real Sometimes when the day is at the end The music is your only thing I'd never venture too far from home All I ever wanted was to be right home And if you have to ask if it's heaven or hell I'm sorry but I'll never tell From my basement, from my basement I can't see the world through my basement From my basement, from my basement I can't see the world through my basement From my basement, I can't see a smile From my basement, I've been standing all the while From my basement, I think I believe From my basement, I think I should never leave From my basement, from my basement I can't see the world through my basement
